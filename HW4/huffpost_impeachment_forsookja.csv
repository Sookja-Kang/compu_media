(See the clip below.)The Official Trump Store'recently started selling T-shirts and posters with the words 'Stop the Witch Hunt!' while portraying Democratic House impeachment leaders Adam Schiff, Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Nadler as the witches from the 1993 film 'Hocus Pocus.' The three appear over an orb with a flag-bearing Trump flying like Superman.The 'witch hunt,' of course, echoes the president's ceaseless use of the term to describe the investigation into his alleged pressuring of Ukraine's president to investigate political rival Joe Biden. Trump also used it to describe Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference.But if Trump and his souvenir makers really wanted to make a statement, maybe they could have started by making sense, Oliver said.'So, it's a witch hunt where the witches are the ones doing the hunting, which is categorically not what a witch hunt is, in the same way a duck hunt doesn't mean a bunch of ducks hunting humans in the woods,' the host said. 'Meanwhile, on the shirt, Trump is depicted as a flying superhero, which has no place in the witch genre.'Oliver also went after the product description, which says: 'The only people scared this Halloween are Shifty Schiff, Nervous Nancy and Democrat Hack Jerry Nadler about their chances in 2020!''In this witch hunt, the witches, even though they are the hunter, are the scared ones,' Oliver said. 'The only scared ones, in fact. It's still the greatest witch-hunt in the history of the USA, but only three people are scared, and all of them are witches. This shirt makes no fucking sense!'Too good- John Oliver on the ridiculous 'Witch Hunt' t-shirts Trump's selling that knock off the Hocus Pocus poster, and why they make 'no fucking sense' pic.twitter.com/aiaYE8ZAI4",2019-11-04 07:01:44

None of the four is expected to appear, for now, according to a person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss the confidential interviews. The other witnesses subpoenaed for testimony on Monday are White House aide Robert Blair, National Security Council aide Michael Ellis and Office of Management and Budget aide Brian McCormack.Democrats want to talk to all four about the machinations inside the White House before and after Trump held a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskiy and asked him to pursue investigations into political rival Joe Biden and his family and Ukraine's involvement in the 2016 election. Eisenberg was instrumental in discussions about how to handle a White House memo recounting the Trump phone call with Ukraine that is central to the impeachment inquiry.Blair is a top aide to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and McCormack is a former chief of staff to Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who led a U.S. delegation to Ukraine for Zelenskiy's inauguration in May.

"6",1436565875,"Another Term For Trump’s Quid Pro Quo? Extortion.","WASHINGTON ' While both the president's defenders and critics have settled on the phrase 'quid pro quo' to describe President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine, some former federal prosecutors have an even simpler description for it: extortion.Federal law makes it a crime for an official to demand or threaten another party to obtain something of value ' a definition that appears to cover Trump's decision to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to the country unless its leader agreed to launch investigations advantageous to Trump's reelection efforts.The relevant law is known as the Hobbs Act, said Danya Perry, a former prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's office in New York City. Its definition of 'extortion' includes obtaining property using 'threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right,' meaning using one's official capacity. The crime is punishable by up to 20 years in prison.'The statute is often applied to a demand or a threat made by a public official in order to obtain something of value in exchange for his or her performance of an official act. The House is examining, among other things, whether the Ukrainian government felt under pressure to investigate the Bidens as a prerequisite to receiving potentially life-saving military assistance,' she said, referring to former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. 'To be clear, we do not yet know how the evidence will play out and certainly there may be valid available defenses, but it is certainly possible to make out a prima facie case.'The White House did not respond to queries about the withheld funds. Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox News on Sunday that the whole question was moot because Ukraine ultimately received the $391 million in military aid ' but failed to note that it was released only after a whistleblower had filed a complaint about the matter. (The whistleblower first raised concern within the administration.)'Bill Weld, who ran the Justice Department's criminal division under President Ronald Reagan and is now running against Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination, said Trump could also be charged with bribery. 'The Hobbs Act is an extortion statute, and the same facts can constitute extortion and bribery, as here,' he said.The House of Representatives moved to open impeachment proceedings against Trump after the White House released a summary of a July 25 phone call showing that, when the Ukrainian president asked about military aid, Trump responded: 'I would like you to do us a favor, though.'Trump and his allies have claimed that his requests for an investigation into Hunter Biden's work for a Ukrainian gas company and Ukraine's role in the origins of the FBI investigation into Trump's 2016 campaign are all about his interest in ending 'corruption.'Yet the White House has been unable to provide examples of Trump's interest in ending alleged 'corruption' except in those two cases, both of which happen to benefit him personally. Trump has long seen the former vice president as the most potent threat to his reelection, and Trump and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have been trying to get Ukraine to publicly announce an investigation into the Bidens since early this year, according to testimony emerging from the impeachment inquiry. Further, Trump's insistence on a probe into Ukraine's supposed role in the 2016 election is, in reality, an attempt to undermine the conclusion reached by both the U.S. intelligence community and former special counsel Robert Mueller that Russia helped Trump win the presidency. Indeed, the'conspiracy theory'that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election ' which Trump's former Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert called 'completely debunked' ' appears to have been spread by Russian intelligence, according to newly released documents from Mueller's investigation.Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor from Illinois, said that prosecuting Trump is unlikely, particularly with impeachment well under way. 'It looks like extortion, and it is certainly corrupt, but I don't believe this is the sort of activity that would actually be prosecuted,' he said. 'Using presidential power in this way is not the sort of thing our criminal justice system is equipped to handle.'Republican senators, who would serve as jurors in an impeachment trial, are now turning to the argument that while Trump did, in fact, make military aid conditional on Ukraine conducting these investigations, such an act is not impeachable ' essentially arguing that presidents are permitted to shape American foreign policy to their own personal benefit.Former Republican congressman Joe Walsh, who is also running against Trump, said that the need to defend Trump will constantly bring his party ever lower.'Every single GOP senator who says it was an 'OK' quid pro quo are lying because they know it's not OK,' Walsh said. 'By not impeaching and removing Trump for what he did, they are telling future presidents that foreign powers can now decide American elections. Like Trump, that's a despicably disloyal thing for GOP senators to say and do.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here's how.",2019-11-04 19:03:26

Chuck Grassley'said Monday that it's 'strictly' up to the whistleblower who triggered the impeachment inquiry whether or not to be identified. The Iowa Republican's comments came a day after an irritated President'Donald Trump called on the media to expose this 'radical' person's identity.Grassley, who has'authored whistleblower laws, has previously defended the anonymous process that protects federal whistleblowers from retaliation at work and physical threats.Asked by reporters to respond to Trump's demand for exposure, the senator said, 'That's strictly up to the whistleblower,' according to The Hill.'He added,''All I want to do is make sure the law is followed. A person like me that has advocated for whistleblowers for a long period of time, including this whistleblower, I want maximum protection for whistleblowers. The law protects the whistleblower,' CNN reported.Trump told reporters on Sunday that they would be doing a 'public service' to name the whistleblower. He insisted that the person 'lied' about his 'perfecto' phone call in July to Ukraine's president (see the video above). In the call, Trump pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into unfounded accusations of corruption against former Vice President'Joe Biden and his son Hunter.Also on Monday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) insisted that Trump should be allowed to confront the whistleblower.Closed-door testimony by U.S. officials before the House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry ' as well as the White House's own rough transcript of the Zelensky call ' has already provided far more information than the original whistleblower complaint.Attorneys for the whistleblower have insisted on protecting their client's identity because there have been death threats, which are being'investigated by the FBI. The whistleblower has offered to answer questions from Republican lawmakers in writing'and under oath. But Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement Sunday that written answers wouldn't be 'sufficient.'Grassley also'defended the whistleblower'in a statement last month.''This person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected,' he wrote.

"8",1436618721,"Former Ukraine Ambassador Lays Out White House Campaign To Oust Her","WASHINGTON (AP) ' It started with a warning to watch her back, that people were 'looking to hurt' her. From there, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told House investigators, it escalated into a chilling campaign to fire her as President Donald Trump and his allies angled in Eastern Europe for political advantage at home.Testimony from Yovanovitch, released Monday, offered a first word-for-word look at the closed-door House impeachment hearings. Inside, Democrats and Republicans are waging a pitched battle over what to make of Trump's efforts to get Ukraine's leaders to investigate political rival Joe Biden, Biden's son and Democratic activities in the 2016 election.The transcript came out on the same day that four Trump administration officials defied subpoenas to testify, acting on orders from a White House that is fighting the impeachment investigation with all its might. Among those refusing to testify: John Eisenberg, the lead lawyer at the National Security Council and, by some accounts, the man who ordered a rough transcript of Trump's phone call with Ukraine's leader moved to a highly restricted computer system.During nine hours of sometimes emotional testimony, Yovanovitch detailed efforts led by Rudy Giuliani and other Trump allies to push her out of her post. The career diplomat, who was recalled from her job in May on Trump's orders, testified that a senior Ukrainian official told her that 'I really needed to watch my back.'While the major thrust of Yovanovitch's testimony was revealed in her opening statement, Monday's 317-page transcript provided new details.Yovanovitch offered significant threads of information including the possibility that Trump was directly involved in a phone call with Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, and the Ukrainians dating back to January 2018. And she pushed back on Republican suggestions that she harbored opposition to Trump.She had been recalled from Kyiv before the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that's at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Later, she was 'surprised and dismayed' by what she saw in the transcript of the call ' including that Trump had called her 'bad news.' He also said that 'she's going to go through some things.''I was shocked,' Yovanovitch said, to see 'that the president would speak about me or any ambassador in that way to a foreign counterpart.'Asked about her as he left on a campaign trip Monday, Trump had a more equivocal comment: 'I'm sure she's a very fine woman. I just don't know much about her.'House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said transcripts from the hearings are being released so 'the American public will begin to see for themselves.' Two were released Monday, and more are coming.Republicans have accused Democrats of conducting a one-sided process behind closed doors.But the transcripts show GOP lawmakers were given time for questioning, which they used to poke at different aspects of the impeachment inquiry. Some Republicans criticized the process as unfair, while others tried to redirect witnesses to their own questions about Biden's work on Ukraine corruption issues while he was vice president.In public, some Republicans say the president's actions toward Ukraine, though not ideal, are certainly not impeachable.Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight committee, defended Yovanovitch's ouster as clearly within the president's prerogative.'President Trump has the authority to name who he wants in any ambassador position. That's a call solely for the president of the United States as the commander in chief,' Jordan said.Yovanovitch was recalled from Kyiv as Giuliani pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate baseless corruption allegations against Biden and his son Hunter, who was involved with Burisma, a gas company there.Giuliani's role in Ukraine was central to Yovanovitch's testimony. She said she was aware of an interest by the Trump lawyer and his associates in investigating Biden and Burisma 'with a view to finding things that could be possibly damaging to a presidential run,' as well as investigating the 2016 election and theories that it was Ukraine, and not Russia, that interfered.However, asked directly if Giuliani was promoting investigations on Burisma and Biden, Yovanovitch said, 'It wasn't entirely clear to me what was going on.'More directly, she drew a link between Giuliani and two businessmen <U+2015> Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who have been indicted in the U.S. on charges stemming from campaign donations <U+2015> as part of the campaign to oust her. She understood they were looking to expand their business interests in Ukraine 'and that they needed a better ambassador to sort of facilitate their business' efforts here.'Yovanovitch said was told by Ukrainian officials last November or December that Giuliani was in touch with Ukraine's former top prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, 'and that they had plans, and that they were going to, you know, do things, including to me.'She said she was told Lutsenko 'was looking to hurt me in the U.S.'The diplomat said she sought advice from Gordon Sondland, Trump's ambassador to the European Union, after an article appeared in The Hill newspaper about Giuliani's complaints against her. Sondland told her, ''You need to go big or go home,' advising her to 'tweet out there that you support the president.'Yovanovitch said she felt she could not follow that advice as a nonpartisan government official.The former envoy stressed to investigators that she was not disloyal to the president. She answered 'no' when asked point blank if she'd ever 'badmouthed' Trump in Ukraine, and said she felt U.S. policy in Ukraine 'actually got stronger' because of Trump's decision to provide lethal assistance to the country ' military aid that later was held up by the White House as it pushed for investigations into Trump's political foes.Long hours into her testimony, Yovanovitch was asked why she was such 'a thorn in their side' that Giuliani and others wanted her fired.'Honestly,' she said, 'it's a mystery to me.'Yovanovitch, still employed by the State Department, is in a fellowship at Georgetown University.She told the investigators that the campaign against her, which included an article that was retweeted by Donald Trump Jr., undermined her ability to serve as a credible ambassador and she wanted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to issue a statement defending her. But no statement was issued.The impeachment panels also released testimony Monday from Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Pompeo.McKinley, a 37-year career diplomat, testified that he decided to resign from his post as a senior adviser to Pompeo after his repeated efforts to get the State Department to issue a statement of support for Yovanovitch after the transcript of the Trump-Zelenskiy phone call was released. 'To see the impugning of somebody I know to be a serious, committed colleague in the manner that it was done raised alarm bells for me,' he said.McKinley said he was already concerned about politicization at the State Department, and that the refusal to publicly back Yovanovitch convinced him it was time to leave.___AP writers Eric Tucker, Matthew Daly, Alan Fram, Ben Fox, Padmananda Rama and Matthew Lee contributed to this reportDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Matt Bevin is seeking a second term. But the president also used the event to launch yet another defense of his behavior and attack the Democratic leaders spearheading the House probe into his call with the leader of Ukraine earlier this year.When the president brought Paul on stage, the senator peddled unfounded claims about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Paul also took aim at the whistleblower, who remains anonymous, echoing Republican calls for the intelligence worker's identity to be revealed.''We also now know the name of the whistleblower. The whistleblower needs to come forward as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs,' Paul said. 'I say tonight to the media, do your job and print his name.'The whistleblower's complaint focused on Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the discussion, Trump demanded that Zelensky investigate the Bidens in exchange for political favors and military aid. Many current and former administration officials have since corroborated that account, and the White House released a summary of the call showing as much.Neither Biden has been accused of any formal wrongdoing.Trump, who has demanded he be able to face the whistleblower and denied the existence of a quid pro quo, seemed slightly taken aback ' but pleased ' by Paul's ferocity on Monday.'Wow, that was excellent,' the president said. 'Thank you.'The Whistleblower gave false information & dealt with corrupt politician Schiff. He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower?

Various conservative media outlets have been sharing an unverified name they believe is the whistleblower, but there has been no outside confirmation.The whistleblower's lawyers have said their client would be willing to answer Republicans''questions under oath as long as lawmakers didn't ask for any identifying information.'Trump and Paul were also joined by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

"14",1437295555,"House Releases Transcripts Of Kurt Volker, Gordon Sondland Impeachment Testimony","House investigators on Tuesday released the transcripts of closed-door interviews with two key officials as part of their impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump: testimony from Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt Volker, the State Department's former special envoy to Ukraine.Among the revelations: Sondland significantly altered his original story in an update to his testimony submitted Monday, in which he acknowledged he was involved in Trump's attempted quid pro quo with Ukraine's government, after previously claiming he could not recall the details.In early October, Volker became the first witness to testify, shortly after a whistleblower complaint revealed Trump asked a foreign government to investigate a potential 2020 election opponent. On a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump requested dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, whose son Hunter has had business dealings in the country. The president then appeared to dangle military aid in an apparent quid pro quo.Both Volker and Sondland appear frequently in reporting and documents about the growing scandal, making them key figures in the House's inquiry.According to his prepared remarks in October, Volker told House investigators that he was not 'fully in the loop' about the call. However, subsequently released text messages revealed he was much more involved than he let on.Similarly, Sondland claimed in prepared remarks from his original testimony'that he could recall 'no discussions with any State Department or White House official about Former Vice President Biden or his son, nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens.''Yet subsequent testimony from Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, contradicted that of Sondland. Vindman, who was listening in on the July 25 call, was so concerned about Trump's demands for an investigation into Biden that he informed a superior, according to prepared remarks of his testimony last week.On Monday, House investigators released the first set of depositions related to the inquiry: recent testimony from Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and P. Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Investigators are expected to continue releasing transcripts of closed-door testimony throughout the coming weeks, as the impeachment inquiry enters a more public phase.A number of White House and administration officials have defied subpoenas and failed to appear to testify, part of the Trump administration's continued efforts to stonewall congressional Democrats investigating the president.White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement Tuesday that the transcripts actually helped the president's case, claiming 'there is even less evidence for this illegitimate impeachment sham than previously thought.''No amount of salacious media-biased headlines, which are clearly designed to influence the narrative, change the fact that the President has done nothing wrong,' she continued.Read the transcripts of Sondland's and Volker's testimony below.This article has been updated with Grisham's statement and to note Sondland's testimony revisions.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) over her proposed wealth tax and criticism of the rich <U+2015> choked up on Monday while raising concerns over the state of the nation.During an appearance on CNBC's 'Halftime Report,' the chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors spoke out against President Donald Trump's behavior while also opposing House Democrats' impeachment probe and arguing that the fate of Trump's administration should be determined on Election Day next year.'His deportment is not presidential and we need a unifier in that position because the country is being torn apart,' Cooperman said. 'I am not in favor of all this impeachment inquiry. I want the American people to decide in November 2020 what the future should be.'Asked by host Scott Wapner why he was becoming noticeably emotional, Cooperman then began tearing up.'I care,' he said. 'That's it.'Taking note of the interview, Warren tweeted that Cooperman cares about his fortune, pointing out that he's a shareholder in student loan company Navient, which has been sued by several states for allegedly cheating borrowers.'I care about an entire generation of students being crushed by student loan debt <U+2015> deferring their American dream because they can't afford it,' she wrote.

"16",1437556162,"Bombshell Impeachment Testimony Perfectly Underscores Lindsey Graham’s Hypocrisy","Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is learning to be careful what he wishes for.Last month, Graham was complaining about not having access to one of the witness transcripts from the impeachment inquiry. He also said if there was real evidence of quid pro quo pressure on Ukraine by President Donald Trump, that 'would be very disturbing.'On Tuesday, House Democrats made public the testimonies of two more witnesses <U+2015>'Kurt Volker, the State Department's former special envoy to Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union. Sondland's transcript came with a significant update: He said he now recalled his own involvement in the quid pro quo effort.Caught in a bind, Graham courageously pledged Tuesday to refuse to read the transcripts.'I've written the whole process off,' the senator'told reporters. 'I think this is a bunch of B.S.'Reporter: 'Do you plan on reading these transcripts that were released?''Graham: 'No.'Graham's refusal marks a sharp reversal from his position in early October'when the senator accused House Democrats of abusing their power because they hadn't released Volker's testimony for all to see.If House D's refuse to release full transcript of Volker testimony as requested by Congressman Jordan, it will be an abuse of power.In a later statement on Tuesday, Graham dismissed Sondland's new testimony as 'unpersuasive''because the diplomat told investigators that he 'presumed' military aid to Ukraine was conditional on the country investigating Trump's political rival Joe Biden.Sondland's acknowledgment of a quid pro quo nevertheless puts Graham in a tricky position.In late September, the senator flatly denied that Trump would ever have threatened aid to Ukraine in such a manner.'But after the White House released a partial, reconstructed version of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky <U+2015> in which he seeks a 'favor' from Zelensky <U+2015> Graham said the call itself wasn't sufficient.'If you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing,' Graham told Axios on Oct. 20.Yet on Tuesday, when presented with that kind of evidence, Graham opted to look away.Let's give Trump the last word:Read the Transcript!Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"18",1437674336,"GOP Holds On In Mississippi Gov Race","Mississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves (R) won the state's gubernatorial race on Tuesday, securing a reliable Republican stronghold for four more years.The race, however, was closer than match-ups in recent elections. President Donald Trump'carried Mississippi by more than 17 percentage points in the 2016 election, but in Tuesday's contest against state Attorney General Jim Hood (D), Reeves won by about 8 percentage points, according to preliminary results.The election prompted fears from some voting rights activists that Republicans would try to leverage their power in the state legislature to benefit Reeves. A Jim Crow-era law gives the Republican-controlled state House the authority to choose the governor if a candidate doesn't win both a majority of the total vote and a majority of the vote in at least half of the state's 122 districts. Hood's supporters had feared a scenario where the Democrat would clear one threshold but not the other, opening the way for lawmakers to deny him the governorship.But Democrats who hoped to flip the state in their favor on Tuesday were disappointed.The party fared well in other parts of the country on Tuesday, however, and took control of both chambers of the Virginia legislature for the first time in decades. Democrat Andy Beshear also declared victory in the Kentucky governor's race, although The Associated Press said the match-up was still too close to call.Reeves won Trump's 'Complete & Total Endorsement' ahead of the election, with the president praising him as 'strong on Crime, tough on Illegal Immigration, and will protect your Second Amendment.' During a rally earlier this month meant to shore up support for Reeves, Trump lambasted the Democratic Party and described the House's impeachment inquiry as a 'disgrace.''They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the moment I won,' the president said at the time, before insisting that Republicans never had 'greater support than we have right now.'The president also called Tuesday's race 'VERY important' for Republicans going into the 2020 election.Reeves will replace Gov. Phil Bryant <U+2015> a staunch conservative who is leaving office due to term limits <U+2015> and has promised to lead the state with similar hard-line policies. Reeves vowed to oppose any expansion of the state's Medicaid program, saying: 'Mississippians believe the way to a better future is not through handouts or bailouts but through hard work and more freedom.'He also cast himself as a firm Trump ally throughout the campaign.'If, God forbid, President Trump is replaced by one of the radical liberals running in 2020, the people of Mississippi will not take kindly to their proposed efforts to confiscate our guns,' Reeves wrote on his campaign website, pledging to protect Second Amendment rights.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"19",1437674331,"Democrats Rack Up Election Wins In The South Ahead Of 2020","Democrats made major gains in state-level elections across the country on Tuesday, revealing President Donald Trump's weakness in even the reddest of states and putting the lie to the idea of a massive voter backlash against House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.'In Kentucky, a state Trump won in 2016 by about 30 percentage points, Attorney General Andy Beshear (D) apparently unseated Republican Gov. Matt Bevin by harnessing discontent with Bevin's attacks on the state's Medicaid expansion and his efforts to pare back public-sector pensions. As of late Tuesday evening, Beshear led Bevin by 0.4 percentage points, though Bevin did not concede the race.''Tonight, voters in Kentucky sent a message loud and clear for everyone to hear. It's a message that our elections don't have to be about right versus left,' Beshear told a celebratory crowd of supporters at his election night watch party in Louisville. 'They are still about right versus wrong.'Although the issues that dominated the race were not national in nature, Trump's inability to rescue Bevin with a last-minute visit spoke to the limits of the president's appeal. At an election-eve rally in Lexington on Monday night, Trump went so far as to tell the crowd of supporters that a loss for Bevin would prompt people 'to say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. You can't let that happen to me!'In Virginia, which has been trending Democratic for at least a decade, the party wiped out the last vestiges of Republican power. By flipping both the House of Delegates and the state Senate, Democrats under the leadership of Gov. Ralph Northam (D) have secured what is known as a 'trifecta' by bringing the state under unified Democratic control. The party now has the authority to not only pass a raft of stalled progressive bills but also to shape the 2021 congressional and legislative redistricting processes, which the GOP used to its advantage in 2011.As of late Tuesday night, the results in Mississippi, which also had a contentious gubernatorial race, were more disappointing for Democrats. Attorney General Jim Hood, a socially conservative Democrat, lost to Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, whom he was trailing by about 8 percentage points with over 80% of the votes in.Early estimates suggested turnout in Kentucky's elections <U+2015> held in what's called an off-off year, when neither congressional seats nor the presidency are at stake <U+2015> was extremely high, indicating an unusually engaged electorate heading into 2020's presidential contest. Some 1.4 million people voted in Kentucky, according to NBC News, up about 400,000 from the last gubernatorial contest four years ago.Democratic gains in the two states followed a similar pattern. The areas that swung hardest for Democrats were in the suburbs of major metropolises, where highly educated, generally upper-middle-class voters have been most dissatisfied with Trump's performance. Beshear performed especially well in the suburbs to the south of Cincinnati, Ohio, for example. And although Trump had lost to Hillary Clinton in Jefferson County, which includes Louisville and its suburbs, by less than 14 percentage points in 2016, Beshear defeated Bevin there by over 35 points. Likewise, though Clinton's margin in Fayette County, which includes Lexington and its suburbs, was less than 10 points, Beshear's was over 32 points.On top of taking back the state, Virginia Democrats celebrated several symbolic wins. Del. Danica Roem (D) won her reelection campaign after she made history in 2017 as the state's first transgender lawmaker. Her opponent, Kelly McGinn, has a long history of homophobic comments, once calling the institution of same-sex adoption 'a social experiment on children.' In Virginia's 10th District, Ghazala Hashmi, an educator and Indian immigrant, ousted Republican incumbent state Sen. Glen Sturtevant, making history as the first Muslim American woman to be elected into Virginia's state legislature. Further down the ballot, Juli Briskman, who made headlines in 2017 for flipping off President Trump's motorcade, won her campaign for board of supervisors in Loudoun County.'The common factor in Democrats' big victories in Kentucky and Virginia is the weakness of Trump's brand. Although Virginia's legislative elections were more directly shaped by the Trump presidency, Trump's inability to help Bevin overcome the unpopularity of his state-level policies demonstrates the president's lack of clout <U+2015> even in a state he won easily and will likely win again in 2020. Given the high turnout among voters bucking Trump's preferred candidates, as well as Democrats' strong performances in metropolitan areas where Trump held Clinton to a narrow margin, the elections suggest Trump is in trouble next year.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"25",1438440897,"How 'Congressman-1' Got Pulled Into Rudy Giuliani's Ukraine Scheme","WASHINGTON <U+2015> It was April 2018, and longtime Rep. Pete Sessions could already tell he was in the race of his life.The Texas Republican had represented parts of north Dallas for 21 years, but the suburban revolt against President Donald Trump was now threatening to end his congressional career. Hillary Clinton had beaten Trump in his district two years before, and Sessions was vulnerable.So when the National Republican Congressional Committee contacted Sessions, asking if he wanted to attend a meet-and-greet fundraiser with the president and high-dollar donors at Mar-a-Lago, the answer was an easy yes. He needed all the help he could get.'Sessions was the only congressman at the April 20, 2018, event, which featured Trump and about three dozen other GOP elites, according to an NRCC document obtained by HuffPost. Among the group were Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee; Brad Parscale, who is now Trump's reelection campaign manager; and Bill Edwards, the billionaire CEO of Mortgage Investors Corporation.But also in the crowd that night were two then-lesser-known names: Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.Parnas and Fruman are the two Soviet-born U.S. citizens who were arrested this month as they attempted to leave the United States with one-way international tickets. They're charged with trying to funnel foreign money to U.S. politicians in order to influence U.S.-Ukraine relations, and they are thus far the biggest arrests in the Ukraine debacle.Trump has said he doesn't know Parnas and Fruman, but admitted there may be pictures'of him with the men at a fundraiser. They were, at least, in the same room at the Mar-a-Lago event.It's also unclear how much time Parnas and Fruman spent talking to Sessions that night, though the federal indictment of the two men mentions they met 'Congressman-1' at the event. Either way, they really didn't need to talk much. They already shared an important connection: Rudy Giuliani. And through that relationship, Parnas and Fruman would later get a more intimate meeting with Sessions as part of their alleged scheme to disrupt U.S. foreign policy for personal gain.'It was around this time that Giuliani, serving as Trump's personal lawyer, was also trying to create controversy around Hunter Biden sitting on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. Giuliani hoped he could get Ukrainian officials to open an investigation into the son of former Vice President Joe Biden and that energy company. The investigation was supposed to stir up the suggestion of wrongdoing by the father, who, as vice president, pushed for the ouster of a Ukranian top prosecutor. Giuliani was looking for evidence to fuel a conspiracy theory that Biden did so to aid his son.'But Parnas and Fruman had another goal for Giuliani: Get the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, removed.The campaign by Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman to oust Yovanovitch appears to have come about through a confluence of interests. Yovanovitch, a career foreign service officer, was an obstacle to Giuliani's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Parnas and Fruman wanted her gone because she stood in the way of their reported scheme to purge the leadership of Naftogaz, Ukraine's national oil and gas company. The indictment of the two men asserts that Parnas' efforts to remove the ambassador were also made, at least partially, at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials.The plan involved replacing Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolev with company executive Andrew Fovorov, NBC News reports. In exchange for making Fovorov the CEO, Parnas and Fruman wanted to be cut in on a liquified natural gas deal ' a deal they believed would happen if Yovanovitch was pushed out. Yovanovitch supported the ongoing anti-corruption reforms that Kobolev had implemented, but with her and Kobolev gone, Parnas and Fruman believed they could sell American natural gas to Ukraine and get rich.That plan never quite worked out, despite Yovanovitch being recalled from her post in May 2019. According to NBC News, Fovorov rejected the scheme, telling Parnas and Fruman that he was loyal to Kobolev.Regardless, for his part, Giuliani received $500,000 from the company that Parnas had founded, Fraud Guarantee. That money opened a number of doors for Parnas and Fruman, including the one into Sessions' office in the Rayburn House Office Building.While Parnas and Fruman had a direct line to President Trump through Giuliani, they also sought last year to build congressional support for removing Yovanovitch. Giuliani had an answer for that, too.'One of Giuliani's longtime business partners, Roy Bailey, was also a GOP megadonor. He also happened to be the campaign chairman for Pete Sessions' 2018 reelection bid. That position was largely a figurehead role <U+2015> essentially it meant Bailey raised a lot of money for Sessions <U+2015> but it also meant Bailey could get almost anyone a meeting with the congressman.Sessions has acknowledged that he had 'a couple additional meetings' with Parnas and Fruman off Capitol Hill as well, but it was the May 9, 2018, meeting in his office that raised the eyebrows of investigators.Whether Parnas and Fruman realized it or not, Sessions was the perfect mark. He had ties with virtually every other Republican representative. He was chairman of the influential House Rules Committee. He was a former chairman of the NRCC, where he helped a number of GOP members get elected. And he was a Texas Republican <U+2015> a brotherhood all its own, with its powerful tentacles wrapped around virtually every issue in Congress.According to former staffers, Sessions, who would lose his reelection bid, was also impressionable enough to do exactly what Parnas and Fruman wanted. As any lobbyist could tell you, Sessions was a useful connection because he was willing to do things like, say, write a letter.'When Sessions met with Parnas and Fruman on May 9 last year, a source familiar with the conversation told HuffPost, Parnas and Fruman emphasized their love of Trump. They said they had actually worked with Trump's father, Fred Trump <U+2015> Parnas previously told The New Yorker'that he sold Trump Organization co-ops in his teens <U+2015> but they also brought up Yovanovitch, telling Sessions that she was bad-mouthing the president in Ukraine.A U.S. ambassador in Ukraine deriding Trump was a curious issue for Sessions to take up. Sessions, who used to brag about being the congressional representative for George W. Bush, was always more of a Bush guy than a Trump fan.But right after Sessions met with Parnas and Fruman, his staff began drafting a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a former Republican member of Congress who came to the House when Sessions was the NRCC chairman.The letter to Pompeo, dated May 11, 2018, is simple and short. It says that Sessions has received 'concrete evidence from close companions that Ambassador Yovanovitch has spoken privately and repeatedly about her disdain for the current Administration.'Sessions does not name Parnas and Fruman. In fact, he said in a recent statement that 'several congressional colleagues' told him the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was 'disparaging President Trump.' He claimed that the congressional chatter was the impetus for his letter, not the meeting he had with Parnas and Fruman.While it's possible'that Sessions heard from other members of Congress about Yovanovitch, it's hard to imagine any lawmaker having 'concrete evidence' of Yovanovitch privately expressing disdain for Trump. And the letter was sent just two days after Sessions' meeting with Parnas and Fruman.'More to the point, Sessions writing letters at the behest of people he met with was standard operating procedure in his office. It would have been out of the ordinary if he didn't offer to write a letter during the meeting, according to former staffers.'Sessions refused to answer questions on the record about last year's meeting, telling HuffPost that he 'had been asked not to do interviews.' A federal grand jury subpoenaed Sessions in October to testify about his role in the Ukraine affair, and Parnas and Fruman were arraigned around the same time as part of a case being pursued by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan. They both pleaded not guilty.Even if Parnas and Fruman didn't mention money during their meeting with Sessions, the implication was clear. These were two men who were at a Mar-a-Lago fundraiser for the president's top donors. They could be helpful to Sessions, if Sessions was helpful to them.The indictment filed against Parnas and Fruman alleges that they 'committed to raise $20,000 or more for a then-sitting U.S. congressman ('Congressman-1'), who had also been the beneficiary of approximately $3 million in independent expenditures by Committee-1 during the 2018 election cycle.'Pete Sessions is 'Congressman-1,' and 'Committee-1' is the Trump-aligned super PAC America First Action, which ended up spending more than $3 million to support Sessions. Parnas and Fruman donated $325,000 to America First Action. They also gave $2,700 each to Sessions' general election campaign a few weeks after their May meeting <U+2015> the maximum direct contribution allowed by law.Those contributions violated campaign finance laws banning anyone from making a contribution in someone else's name, according to the federal indictment. Parnas and Fruman made the $325,000 contribution to Trump's super PAC through a shell corporation called Global Energy Producers LLC. Federal investigators say this company did no business and was not even active at the time it made the contribution.'As for the contributions to Sessions' campaign, those made by Parnas were actually funded by Fruman, according to the indictment. This allowed Fruman to evade campaign contribution limits and donate more than the max to the congressman. Through a series of wire transfers, Fruman gave Parnas the $2,700 for the donation to Sessions, as well as $11,000 for a contribution to the NRCC fundraising committee, Protect the House, which was also meant to help Sessions.'Sessions has not been indicted and is not alleged to have known that Fruman and Parnas were evading contribution limits.Federal prosecutors also allege that Fruman concealed some of his donations by misspelling his name as 'Furman.' He went even further in his April 27, 2018, donation to the House Majority Trust, a joint committee of the NRCC and the RNC for which Sessions was helping raise money at Mar-a-Lago on April 20. As The Daily Beast reported, the related'Federal Election Commission filing lists the faux 'Furman' with the same occupation as a real Los Angeles-based doctor named Igor Furman. A spokesperson for Dr. Furman's company told The Daily Beast that he never made a donation to the House Majority Trust.Fruman was also misrepresented in the NRCC document for the April 20 event obtained by HuffPost. He was listed as 'Igor Furman,' and his bio and picture were those of Dr. Furman. The NRCC did not return a request for comment on whether that was their mistake or whether Fruman sent inaccurate information.Despite all the financial help from Trump's super PAC and his two decades representing north Dallas, Sessions lost to Democrat Colin Allred in November 2018. Sessions is currently toying with the idea of running for another Texas congressional seat <U+2015> this one stretching from Waco to the suburbs of Austin <U+2015> that is being vacated by Republican Bill Flores. Or, he has said, he may seek a rematch with Allred for his old seat.'But these days, instead of his Texas twang ringing out in the Rules Committee, the name 'Pete Sessions' is heard most often behind closed doors in the House Intelligence Committee, as that panel investigates the Ukraine controversy as part of its impeachment inquiry.'When Yovanovitch's testimony was released earlier this week, Sessions' name was all over the transcript.'Still, it wouldn't be impossible for Sessions to win his way back to Congress with the Ukrainian cloud hanging over him. In a sense, Sessions' path hews closely to the overall trajectory of the GOP: a Bush-loving, war-fighting party that now values fealty to Trump above all else.And if Sessions digs in, if he insists there was nothing wrong with meeting with Parnas and Fruman or writing a letter to the secretary of state urging that a U.S. ambassador be fired, he may actually endear himself to Trump and his Republican allies.It would be the final transformation for a congressman whom a future Trump enthusiast <U+2015> 2016 presidential campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson <U+2015> once tried to knock off in a primary challenge.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!Bondi has maintained close ties with Trump during her political career. Through his personal foundation, Trump donated $25,000 to Bondi's reelection campaign in 2013. In 2014, Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, hosted a swanky fundraiser for Bondi with tickets boasting a $3,000-per-person price tag.Those donations came at a time when Bondi was under pressure to join other state attorneys general'as they filed lawsuits against Trump University, alleging the company was scamming students out of their money. Bondi ultimately decided not to join any lawsuits against Trump University.'After serving her second term as attorney general, Bondi joined the lobbying firm Ballard Partners in January 2019, according to The Washington Post.Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been pushing for the White House to hire Sayegh to lead a team focused on impeachment issues, CNN reported in October. Sayegh served as the Treasury Department's assistant secretary of public affairs under Secretary Steven Mnuchin but left the department earlier this year.He is credited with playing an instrumental role in Trump's Republican tax reform bill in 2017.Trump initially resisted forming a communications team to tackle the fallout over the ongoing impeachment probe, which was launched after a whistleblower report accused him of coercing the Ukranian president to investigate a political opponent during a July 25 phone call.Trump told reporters late last month that he could handle all the impeachment concerns himself.'Here's the thing: I don't have teams. Everyone is talking about teams. I'm the team. I did nothing wrong,' Trump said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here's how.",2019-11-06 17:00:28
"27",1438527976,"Democrats Have A Democrat Problem","Most Democrats expect the governing agenda of the next Democratic president to be set by, well, whomever that next president might be. Ben Cardin, Democratic senator from Maryland, has other ideas.'I think we'll take up our own proposals,' Cardin told The Hill on Tuesday. Asked if he would vote for a 'Medicare for All' package ' a policy supported by the two most popular 2020 contenders in the Iowa caucuses <U+2015> the 76-year-old Cardin suggested the bill wouldn't even be granted a vote.''I don't know that we'll have a chance to do that,' he said.Over the past two years, progressives frustrated with the timidity of the Democratic Party's opposition to President Donald Trump have trained their fire on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Pelosi's caucus had to drag her kicking and screaming into opening an impeachment inquiry into the president, and she repeatedly invokes political constraints as a reason to eschew a progressive agenda. 'What works in San Francisco does not necessarily work in Michigan,' she recently told Bloomberg.As a practical matter, Pelosi's political instincts have been unreliable all year. Impeachment is popular, and both Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are polling just fine against Trump in Michigan, a state Hillary Clinton lost in 2016. But the deeper problem is not her judgment, but the outdated attitude she and other Washington Democrats like Cardin have maintained even as Democratic voters have moved on.'The politics of the 2020 primary will alter public opinion, but a fall 2018 survey by the liberal think tank Data for Progress found a broad base of support for progressive policies among all voters ' not just Democrats ' with 68 percent supporting a wealth tax on fortunes of $100 million or more, 64 percent supporting a green energy infrastructure project and 57 percent supporting fully legalized marijuana. In July 2019, a Data for Progress/YouGov poll showed roughly 80 percent of Democrats support expanding Medicare into 'the main health insurance provider for all Americans.' the months since, Medicare for All polling has depended a lot on what Democrats on television have been saying about it.There is a strange balancing act taking place in which elected officials recognize that they must describe themselves as 'progressive' in order to meet the approval of rank-and-file Democratic voters, while at the same time insisting that ambitious reforms are dangerous and immoral.''I don't find anything progressive about saddling our kids and our grandkids with a balance sheet that is so far in the red that they'll never be able to dig their way out,' Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) told the Hill last month, dismissing Medicare for All with a talking point ripped straight from conservative think tanks.This is the caucus that warns us that Trump is a dangerous and unstable president, while voting to expand his military budget. It's the caucus that decries Trump's giveaways to the super rich, but lines up to support his bank deregulation bill. And it's the caucus that believes Senate Democrats should be slamming the door on the next president's agenda a full year before the election is even held.This tension between Democratic voters and their leaders has been evident all year. Back in June, the party experienced its most serious rupture'in years after Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) cut a deal to send billions of dollars in fresh funding to Trump's border detention camps.'Saikat Chakrabarti, a progressive activist then serving as chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, responded with a Twitter screed in which he tore into 'fiscally conservative' members of the New Democrat and Blue Dog caucuses as 'the new Southern Democrats.' 'They certainly seem hell bent to do to black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did in the '40s,' he wrote in a since-deleted Tweet.'The analogy was more than a little overwrought; the most glaring divide between the Dixiecrats of yore and their northern colleagues was over Jim Crow and civil rights. But recent polling from Pew Research Center shows that today's Democratic party is more united and more progressive than ever around questions of race and immigration. What made the June vote so deflating was that elected Democrats in Washington had simply failed to stand up for the obvious values of their voters.But Chakrabarti was correct to note that a fissure has opened within the party, one that may well put an expiration date on the emerging Democratic mega-coalition. Since the Barack Obama presidency, rank-and-file Democrats have proved ideologically flexible <U+2015> they generally identify as 'progressive''or 'liberal''but continue to support more conservative Democratic incumbents in primary elections. Voters are typically willing to defer to top Democrats for what counts as 'liberal' or 'progressive.''With a Republican in the White House, these contradictory impulses have had few governing implications.'But the increasingly fractious disputes among elected Democrats and liberal intellectuals that have been breaking out since Trump's election will eventually filter down to the electorate <U+2015> particularly if either Warren or Sanders win the presidential nomination and Democrats in the Senate continue to badmouth key planks of their agenda.'The sheer size of the Democratic voter wave on the horizon, meanwhile, seems to indicate that there will eventually be a lot of variation among them come 2021, especially as those voters begin to look beyond a common loathing for Trump. In the past, such massive coalitions have been key to progressive policy victories, but they have involved often vicious intraparty feuds that demanded skillful leadership and a willingness to risk political majorities for the sake of policy victories.Though primary voters continue to fret about 'electability' as their overriding concern heading into the presidential primaries, the trend line for 2020 is a Democratic blowout. In 2017, Democrats crushed in the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races and picked up a Senate seat in Alabama <U+2015> repeat, Alabama. In 2018, Democrats romped from Oklahoma City to Orange County, California, picking up 41 House seats and a Senate seat in Arizona. On Tuesday night, Democrats won a gubernatorial election in Kentucky and appear to have extinguished the last remnants of the Republican Party as an electoral force in Virginia.As ever, the future remains unwritten, but there is currently every reason to believe that Nov. 3, 2020, will be a big night for the Democratic Party. The sheer disgust that Trump evokes in much of the electorate is mobilizing otherwise ambivalent citizens to participate in record numbers, and most of them are voting Democrat. Voter turnout on Tuesday night was the highest for a Kentucky gubernatorial election in 24 years. Nationwide turnout in 2018 was the highest in 40 years for a midterm election.The big question will be what to do with this majority, which may not last long and may not reappear for decades to come. For many Democrats in Washington, the answer is: not much. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here's how.",2019-11-06 17:36:04
"28",1438549662,"Republicans Defend Trump After Top Diplomats Confirm Quid Pro Quo","WASHINGTON <U+2015> Republicans continued to insist this week that President Donald Trump did nothing wrong even after several top diplomats in his administration confirmed that he did, in fact, attempt a quid pro quo by withholding aid to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into a political opponent.'This type of diplomacy is sometimes not fun to watch, but nonetheless, it has existed. It hardly rises to an impeachable offense,' Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said Wednesday.House impeachment investigators this week released bombshell testimony from two witnesses underscoring the lengths Trump went to in urging Ukraine to open an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, while his father was in office.'That was my clear understanding, security assistance money would not come until the [Ukrainian] President committed to pursue the investigation,' Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine,'said in his deposition transcript'that was released Wednesday.Gordon Sondland, the Trump donor who was appointed ambassador to the European Union,'on Monday'revised the testimony he gave last month, acknowledging that he was involved in Trump's attempted quid pro quo with Ukraine's government after previously claiming he could not recall the details. In his updated statement, Sondland said he now recalled telling an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sept. 1 that 'resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur' until Ukraine issued a public statement announcing an investigation into Burisma.But Senate Republicans waived off the revelations by expressing deep skepticism and even outright denial, characterizing the testimony from the two officials as much ado about nothing.'Regardless of how many people you bring out to make the point, I don't think that's going to do the job for most of us to change our opinion,' said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), adding that he preferred to rely instead on the summary of Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, which he argued showed no quid pro quo.Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) also said he doubted the existence of a quid pro quo because Trump had personally told him in a conversation in late August that there was none.'I think the question that still needs to be asked ' OK, Sondland was doing these things, he's talking to different people ' was the president aware of any of these things? ... When I talked to him Aug. 31, he vehemently denied it,' Johnson said, referring to Trump.Johnson, who serves as the vice chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, also took issue with the media, accusing it of mischaracterizing Trump's requests to Ukraine that it investigate the 2016 presidential election and the origins of Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation.'The news media is always saying, 'He's trying to dig up dirt on this 2020 opponent,'' Johnson said. 'No, he's trying to figure out what happened in 2016.'Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a top Trump ally, has veered in his response to the controversy from saying he would not read any of the House impeachment transcripts because they are 'a bunch of B.S,' to throwing out yet another argument on Wednesday: that Trump's administration was simply too incompetent to carry out the quid pro quo.'What I can tell you about the Trump policy toward the Ukraine, it was incoherent, it depends on who you talk to. They seem to be incapable of forming a quid pro quo,''Graham said.Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who is a lawyer, approached the matter a wholly different way. He argued that Trump may have engaged in a quid pro quo but that it could have been appropriate if the president had a legitimate motive.'The quid pro quo is a red herring unless you make a distinction between a legal quid pro quo and an illegal quid pro quo,' Kennedy said. 'All you're talking about is the president's motive; whether he had a good faith basis to do what he did.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here's how.",2019-11-06 18:32:08
"29",1438755818,"Giuliani Hires His Own Team Of Lawyers As Investigations Into Ukraine Ramp Up","Rudy Giuliani, a personal lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump and a central figure in a congressional impeachment inquiry, has hired lawyers to represent him as prosecutors examine his interactions with two men arrested on campaign finance charges.A former New York mayor and federal prosecutor, Giuliani wrote on Twitter that he is being represented by three New York lawyers - Robert Costello, a former Manhattan federal prosecutor, Eric Creizman and Melissa Madrigal.Giuliani is under scrutiny by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office in connection with Ukraine-born Lev Parnas and Belarus-born Igor Fruman, a law enforcement source told Reuters last month.Parnas and Fruman were arrested in October on charges of illegally funneling money to a pro-Trump election committee and other political candidates. They have pleaded not guilty.Giuliani has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.He is central to a Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into whether Republican Trump abused his office for political gain.The investigation I conducted concerning 2016 Ukrainian collusion and corruption, was done solely as a defense attorney to defend my client against false charges, that kept changing as one after another were disproven.The evidence, when revealed fully, will show that this present farce is as much a frame-up and hoax as Russian collusion, maybe worse, and will prove the President is innocent.The inquiry is focused on a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served as a director of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.In a transcript released on Wednesday of testimony'here'by Bill Taylor, the top U.S. envoy in Ukraine, Giuliani was mentioned 68 times. At one point, Taylor spoke of when it became clear a meeting between Zelenskiy and Trump was conditioned on investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian influence in the 2016 elections.'It was also clear that this condition was driven by the irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided by Mr. Giuliani,' Taylor testified.For nearly a year, Giuliani has pursued unsubstantiated allegations that Biden pushed to fire a Ukrainian prosecutor to stop him from investigating Burisma. Giuliani has said Parnas and Fruman assisted him in this effort.'Giuliani also told Reuters he played a role in the effort to remove Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine recalled in May.'You can knock yourself out looking at everything I do and I do not break laws,' Giuliani said in an Oct. 14 interview.Giuliani tweeted on Wednesday that the investigation he conducted into what he called Ukrainian collusion and corruption was in defense of Trump, who he said was wrongly accused of colluding with Russia to influence his 2016 election.A spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment. Creizman confirmed he was representing Giuliani. Costello did not immediately return a call for comment.Costello has represented deceased hotel mogul Leona Helmsley and the late George Steinbrenner, who owned the New York Yankees.According to his firm's website, Costello served as the former deputy chief of the criminal division for the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York, which brought the charges against Parnas and Fruman. Giuliani led that office from 1983 to 1989.Parnas and Fruman are accused of using a shell company to donate $325,000 to the pro-Trump committee, America First Action, and raising money for former Texas Congressman Pete Sessions as part of an effort to remove the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.Giuliani told Reuters in October that he was paid $500,000 to provide business and legal advice to Fraud Guarantee, a company Parnas co-founded.Giuliani has said he had no involvement in the flow of money at the heart of the indictment of Parnas and Fruman.As part of their impeachment inquiry, House Democrats have subpoenaed Giuliani's communications in connection with his efforts to push the Ukraine investigation.Trump has derided the congressional probe as a political smear, and Giuliani has said he would not cooperate.Trump added Giuliani to his legal defense team in April 2018 in connection with the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 election to undermine Trump's Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Giuliani quickly went on a media blitz in defense of Trump. [nL1N21E0IV]In March, Mueller determined there was insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump and Russia.Costello told Reuters in March he had known Giuliani for 45 years. Last year, he asked him about the possibility of Trump pardoning Michael Cohen, the president's former fixer and lawyer.In an April 21, 2018, email that leaked, Costello told Cohen he could 'sleep well tonight. You have friends in high places.'Yet, Costello said in the March interview, Giuliani had shot down the idea of a pardon.Cohen, 52, pleaded guilty in 2018 to directing payments of $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels and $150,000 to Playboy model Karen McDougal to avert a scandal shortly before the 2016 presidential election. Trump has denied having the encounters more than a decade ago with Daniels and McDougal.Reporting by Jan Wolfe in Washington and Karen Freifeld in New York; Additional reporting by Brendan Pierson; Editing by Noeleen Walder, Howard Goller and Grant McCool.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"32",1439171993,"How A Gang Of Angry Teachers Beat Kentucky’s Donald Trump","Nema Brewer's phone buzzed a little after 9 p.m. on Tuesday as she sat at home alone, too anxious to be around anyone else on an election night she'd spent nearly two years waiting for.''Y'all are going to win this,' the incoming message, from a Republican friend Brewer had come to know well, told her. Too nervous to leave her home, Brewer frantically searched the internet for confirmation that Gov. Matt Bevin, Kentucky's unpopular leader, had really lost.'Even when Democrat'Andy Beshear declared victory a few minutes after 10 p.m. ' a result Bevin'hasn't formally accepted ' Brewer still wasn't sure it was real.'We always believed that we could shock the world,' Brewer told HuffPost on Wednesday. 'But it was still kind of shocking when we did it.'Aside from the governor himself, no one did more to cement Bevin's status as the least-popular Republican governor in the United States than Brewer, the public school employee who sparked Kentucky's mass mobilization of teachers last year, when thousands of educators responded to Bevin's proposed changes to public pensions by calling in sick and shutting down Kentucky schools.Bevin has spent four years mimicking President Donald Trump's bullying approach to politics. He has turned his ire on nearly anyone who questioned him, and the anger he inspired in so many Kentuckians seemed to turn Tuesday's election into a referendum on the governor, so much so that he was the only Republican on Kentucky's ballot who failed to win.'But in a red state like Kentucky, where Trump is popular and the GOP is, too, beating Bevin was never going to be easy. It took nearly perfect circumstances in the Bluegrass State ' and required a candidate, a party, a campaign and an energized grassroots movement working in concert to take advantage of it.'And it needed teachers.'The campaign to oust Bevin began on a blustery, cold day in April 2018, after the governor and Republicans in the state legislature forced through changes to an overburdened public pension system for teachers and state workers. Decades of teacher frustration over cuts to public education budgets'erupted into massive protests in Frankfort, the state's sleepy capital city, as thousands of red-clad educators, many of them locked out of legislative proceedings inside, swore to 'remember in November' and drive Republicans out of office.The protests, which followed a similar outburst in West Virginia, were initially organized in a Facebook group called KY 120 United, which Brewer and another school employee had set up to link teachers in districts across the state. Its membership ranks swelled to nearly 40,000.'A record number of Kentucky educators launched bids for public office during the 2018 campaign cycle, many with eyes set on state legislative seats. The teachers scored some early wins, but overall, 2018 was a bit of a disappointment. Republicans retained supermajority control of the state legislature, despite the best efforts of Democrats. The teachers tried not to get discouraged.''We've been singularly focused on Matt Bevin for a year and a half,' Brewer said.So, too, has Beshear. Always Bevin's most likely opponent in 2019, the son of popular former Gov. Steve Beshear used his post as state attorney general to antagonize Bevin, particularly through lawsuits that attempted to block some of the governor's biggest priorities. Beshear quickly allied himself with the teacher movement, greeting them on the steps of the capitol during the protests and taking up their cause. He sued Bevin to block the implementation of the pension bill, and in December, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled in his ' and teachers' ' favor.As the governor's race began to heat up in 2019, the teachers helped set the agenda in the Democratic primary, focusing the race on public education in particular. Beshear, who had chosen high school assistant principal Jacqueline Coleman ' an original KY 120 United member ' as his running mate, won the primary in May, and turned his attention toward the fall election against his archrival.'The teachers were ready, too. The experience of 2018 left Brewer feeling like they had 'gotten our sea legs a little bit,' and were more organized and prepared to boost Bevin's opponent.From that point on, the teacher movement, which included other public workers and labor unions from the beginning, and Beshear ' along with a Kentucky Democratic Party hell-bent on not losing again, after ugly defeats in 2015, to Bevin, and 2016, when Democrats lost a centurylong grip on the state House ' formed something of a symbiotic relationship that benefited them both.'Beshear wanted to focus the race on economic issues, like Bevin's cuts to public education, his targeting of public pensions, and his attempts to end Kentucky's embrace of Medicaid and Obamacare. Beshear showed an uncanny ability to stay on message, but the teachers also made that easier. The prominence of their issues in the race weakened Bevin's attempts to go after Beshear on social issues like abortion, and turned what Bevin wanted to be a national referendum on Trump and impeachment into a fight over local issues.When Beshear argued that Bevin was a bully who broke with Kentucky's more polite politics, the teachers provided a relatable face of who, exactly, Bevin had targeted.''Everybody has a teacher they can look back on and say they helped them and made a difference,' said David Patterson, communications director for the Kentucky Education Association. 'And those people decided that this drumbeat of denigrating and attacking teachers wasn't going to fly.'And when Beshear, whom statewide Democrats have hailed for running one of the most organized campaigns in Kentucky history, needed an army of volunteers to help turn out the vote, the teachers were there. Nearly 1,000 educators volunteered for Beshear's campaign, Patterson said.Beshear and the state party knocked on more than 1 million doors during the campaign, and ran a get-out-the-vote operation that helped turn out voters in deep blue areas of the state, like Lexington and Louisville, and in rural counties. The teachers, meanwhile, staged election events in nearly all of the state's 120 counties, Patterson said, and ran their own canvassing efforts.'We knocked on so many doors, Brewer said. 'We had people who'd been out for months knocking on doors. We sent text messages. We made phone calls to friends and family. We had days of action. I've never seen so much engagement from people who'd never done it before.'And in the end, the teachers allowed Beshear to aggressively expand the political map. One of the most impressive feats of Beshear's campaign is that he managed to appeal to both progressive-minded base voters in the big blue cities and more rural areas of the state that typically favor Republicans, seemingly without compromising on issues that normally terrify Kentucky Democrats. (Beshear supports abortion rights and some limited gun control measures.) Beshear ran up a 100,000-vote margin over Bevin in Louisville, won numerous counties in the Appalachian coalfields, and flipped suburban counties in northern and western Kentucky where Democrats had struggled to make inroads before.Early on, his campaign believed it could contend in those areas, and conservative educators, angry over Bevin's targeting of teachers, helped: Some even'canvassed for Beshear just three years after voting for Trump.There are any number of factors that change a statewide race that's decided by 5,000 votes, and any number of groups that may have made the difference: Beshear and his campaign, a revitalized Kentucky Democratic Party, the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Governors Association ' both of which poured late money into the race while leaving the particulars to locals who knew where it needed to be spent best ' and the activists on the ground.But after Beshear won on Tuesday, seemingly everyone reserved praise for the teachers. Beshear thanked them in his victory speech, and multiple Democratic officials used the same descriptor to describe their impact on the race.''They were huge,' said state Senate Minority Leader Morgan McGarvey.Brewer, meanwhile, said this election was the first time in her time as an organizer 'that the grassroots was really accepted in the process. Instead of us being the agitators, we were a part of the conversation. And I really commend the Beshear campaign for that.'The immediate aftermath of Beshear's somewhat shocking victory in a state Trump won by nearly 30 points just three years ago led to searches for national meaning, even in a race defined by its distinctly local flavors.Republicans downplayed any national implications of the loss. The party held on to two state legislative districts that were up for grabs, and actually won control of two statewide offices Democrats had long held. Daniel Cameron, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, won the state attorney general race ' an office Democrats had held for more than 70 years. And Republicans took over the secretary of state office. Those victories, they argue, show Bevin's loss was about him more than any broader problems for Trump or the GOP as a whole.''Only Bevin lost, but one bad apple did not spoil the bunch,' Scott Jennings, a Louisville-based GOP strategist, wrote on Twitter.Many Republicans were reluctant to fully engage in post-defeat soul searching, noting Bevin was still contesting the race. In the campaign's final days, the party increasingly worked to nationalize the race and inject culture war topics into the state's electoral bloodstream.'President Trump and Gov. Bevin are making Kentucky great again,' a narrator said in one of the final ads from the Republican Governors Association. 'But socialists in Washington want to impeach Trump and take us backward. Andy Beshear is part of their radical resistance.''As the narrator mentioned impeachment, images of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared onscreen.And on Monday night, Republicans flew in Trump himself to make the case for Bevin. ('If you win, they are going to make it like, ho hum. And if you lose, they are going to say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. You can't let that happen to me!' Trump declared.)The move made sense ' Trump remains popular in the state, and polling showed more than 60% of Kentucky voters oppose impeaching the president. But Democrats suggested Trump's campaign rally may have backfired in cities like Louisville and Lexington, where voters detest the president and huge margins voting for Beshear helped doom Bevin.''His showing up probably energized Democrats as much as it did Republicans,' Self, the Kentucky Democratic Party chairman, said. 'While they had folks sitting in an arena, we had folks knocking on doors. And one of those certainly affects an election more than the other.'National Republicans argued that their strategy of nationalizing the race was effective ' Beshear's negative ratings from voters rose slowly throughout the campaign ' but simply wasn't enough to convince conservative-leaning voters to put their personal dislike of Bevin aside.'National Democrats, meanwhile, were touting Beshear's narrow focus on economic issues as a way the party could triumph in other red state gubernatorial races.''He was able to cut through that national noise.

"33",1439290819,"Senate Advances Controversial Judicial Nominee Steven Menashi","WASHINGTON <U+2015> The Senate Judiciary Committee voted Thursday to move forward with one of President Donald Trump's most contentious judicial nominees yet: Steven Menashi, a 40-year-old White House legal aide with a record of opposing and undermining rights for women, LGBTQ people and communities of color.Every Republican on the committee voted to send Menashi's nomination to the Senate floor for his confirmation vote. Every Democrat voted no.Menashi, who is on track to be confirmed to a lifetime seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, has drawn fierce opposition from civil rights groups, Democratic senators and at least one GOP senator over his wildly offensive past writings, his lack of experience and his refusal to answer senators' questions about policies he worked on as the president's legal adviser.'In past editorials, Menashi compared race data collection in college admissions to Germany under Adolf Hitler; denounced women's marches against sexual assault; opposed the 'radical abortion rights codified in Roe v. Wade;' and claimed that a Dartmouth fraternity wasn't being racist when it held a 'ghetto party' attended by white students donning Afros and carrying toy guns.He also spread the Islamophobic myth that in 1913 Gen. John Pershing executed Muslim prisoners in the Philippines using bullets dipped in pig fat.During his confirmation hearing last month, Menashi angered both Republican and Democratic senators by refusing to give any details about his White House legal work.'He conceded, however, that he worked on immigration policies with Trump's senior adviser Stephen Miller, the chief architect of Trump's ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and Trump's policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.He also served as legal counsel to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos when she rolled back Title IX protections'for survivors of sexual assault on campuses.On Thursday, Democrats on the committee took turns ripping Menashi's record, temperament and lack of experience.''I'm trying to remember any nominee so unqualified as this one,' said longtime Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.).'The guy is a calamity,' said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), calling his behavior in his confirmation hearing 'bizarre, arrogant and evasive.'Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) wondered aloud why the White House couldn't have found anyone more qualified for a lifetime federal judgeship.'He has never tried a case. He has never argued an appeal, nor has he made any oral arguments in court. He has never conducted a deposition. He has zero experience handling criminal cases. He could not even name a single time when he observed a criminal trial,' Durbin said. 'I believe nominees for a federal judgeship should know their way around a federal court room.'Republicans defended Menashi, if weakly.'He's written some really weird stuff,' said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). 'He's different than I would have chosen, but I think he's led a consequential life.'Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who previously told HuffPost he was 'doubtful' he'd support Menashi, said he's had a change of heart.'Some of his views are eclectic and some of them I don't agree with,' Kennedy said. 'I'm going to vote for his nomination because I think his reasons are carefully, carefully articulated.'The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals is based in New York, where'Menashi doesn't have support from either of his home state's senators,'which is embarrassing and rarely happens. Alarmingly, he has also'ignored senators' questions about his potential role in White House efforts to hide evidence of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the center of the House impeachment inquiry. Menashi has been Trump's legal adviser for more than a year.'Steven Menashi may have participated in the Ukraine cover-up, and now some Republicans want to promote him from covering for Trump in the White House to covering for him on the federal bench,''said Chris Kang of Demand Justice, a progressive judicial advocacy group. 'With this confirmation vote, we'll see if Senators' allegiances lie with justice or with Donald Trump.'Demand Justice plans to run digital ads targeting a handful of Republican senators <U+2015> some of whom are politically vulnerable, some of whom might legitimately have problems with parts of Menashi's record ' pressuring them to vote no on Menashi, ahead of his confirmation vote. They are Sens. Mitt Romney (Utah), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Martha McSally (Ariz.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Thom Tillis (N.C.) and Joni Ernst (Iowa).Menashi's nomination now heads to the Senate floor for a confirmation vote, the timing of which will be decided by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"34",1439393240,"Tom Steyer Aide Offered Donations In Exchange For Endorsements","DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) ' A top aide to Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer in Iowa has privately offered campaign contributions to local politicians in exchange for endorsing his White House bid, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the conversations.The overtures from Pat Murphy, a former state House speaker who is serving as a top adviser on Steyer's Iowa campaign, aren't illegal ' though payments for endorsements would violate campaign finance laws if not disclosed. There's no evidence that any Iowans accepted the offer or received contributions from Steyer's campaign as compensation for their backing.But the proposals could revive criticism that the billionaire Steyer is trying to buy his way into the White House. Several state lawmakers and political candidates said they were surprised Steyer's campaign would think he could buy their support.Tom Courtney, a former Democratic state senator from southeastern Iowa who's running for reelection to his old seat, told The Associated Press the financial offer 'left a bad taste in my mouth.'Murphy didn't respond to a request for comment. Alberto Lammers, Steyer's campaign press secretary, said Murphy was not authorized to make the offers and that the campaign leadership outside of Iowa was unaware that he was doing so until the issue was raised by The Associated Press.Courtney declined to name Murphy as the Steyer aide who made the offer, but several other local politicians said they received similar propositions, and all confirmed the proposal came from Murphy himself. Most requested anonymity to speak freely about the issue. Another, Iowa state Rep. Karin Derry, said Murphy didn't explicitly offer a specific dollar amount, but made it clear Derry would receive financial support if she backed Steyer.'It was presented more as, he has provided financial support to other downballot candidates who've endorsed him, and could do the same for you,' she said.Courtney described a similar interaction with Steyer's campaign.'Tom, I know you're running for Senate. I'm working for Tom Steyer,' Courtney recalled hearing from the aide. 'Now you know how this works. ...He said, 'you help them, and they'll help you.'''I said, 'it wouldn't matter if you're talking monetary, there's no amount,'' Courtney continued. 'I don't do that kind of thing.'Lammers, Steyer's campaign press secretary, said the candidate hasn't made any individual contributions to local officials in Iowa and won't be making any this year. In an email, Lammers said Steyer's endorsements 'are earned because of Tom's campaign message,' and distanced the candidate from Murphy.'Our campaign policy is clear that we will not engage in this kind of activity, and anyone who does is not speaking for the campaign or does not know our policy,' Lammers said.The overtures do not appear to have made much of a difference for Steyer. Aside from Murphy's support, Steyer has received the endorsement of just one Iowan since entering the race in July ' former state Rep. Roger Thomas.Thomas did not respond to phone calls, but in a statement provided by the campaign, he said that he endorsed Steyer 'because he's the outsider who can deliver for Iowans on the issues that matter most: getting corporate corruption out of our politics and putting forth a rural agenda that revitalizes communities across Iowa.'Thomas' endorsement was issued in October after the close of the most recent campaign finance reporting period, which ended Sept. 30. The disclosure Steyer filed offers no indication that he directly gave Thomas any money.Experts say a campaign could violate campaign finance laws if they don't disclose payments for endorsements.'It's legal if you disclose a payment for an endorsement on your campaign finance report,' said Adav Noti, a former Federal Election Commission attorney who now works for the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center in Washington. But, he added, 'It would be unlawful if you don't disclose it, or you disclose it but try to hide who the recipient is, or try to hide what that purpose was.'A trio of former Ron Paul aides faced legal trouble in 2016 over similar issues during the 2012 Iowa Republican caucus campaign. Campaign chairman Jesse Benton, campaign manager John Tate and deputy campaign manager Dimitri Kesari were convicted in 2016 of charges related to arranging and concealing payments for then-Iowa state Sen. Kent Sorenson, who switched his support from then-Rep. Michele Bachmann to Paul just six days before the Iowa caucuses. Sorenson served 15 months in jail for his role in the scheme.It's unclear whether Murphy could face a similar legal complaint, but the issue could revive scrutiny of how Steyer is deploying his financial resources. The billionaire businessman built his fortune in banking and investment management before turning to politics, and though he's never held public office he invested tens of millions of dollars in political activism and electoral politics before launching his presidential bid this year. Prior to his presidential run, Steyer's most recent focus was a multi-million-dollar, pro-impeachment campaign, and as the U.S. House takes up the issue, he's argued he's put it on the national agenda.Steyer has largely self-funded his presidential campaign, spending $47.6 million of his own money in the first three months since launching his bid, much of that on online fundraising and advertising. Steyer has qualified for the November debate, but he remains at the back of the pack in early-state and national polls.Associated Press writer Brian Slodysko in Washington contributed to this report.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The anonymous author had'published an op-ed in The New York Times last year claiming there was a 'resistance' within the administration of President Donald Trump. Both the Times and the publisher of 'A Warning' say the person is a current or former senior White House official.In the book, Anonymous claims high-ranking White House officials took an informal poll of Cabinet members to determine who would consider invoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office sometime in 2017. The alleged tally was taken soon after the president fired FBI Director James Comey, a decision that ultimately resulted in the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller and dogged the Trump presidency for nearly two years.Anonymous claimed that the senior officials who first took the poll believed Pence would support the removal of Trump and take his place as commander in chief if a majority of the Cabinet supported it. HuffPost was not able to confirm the vice president's position on the potential use of the 25th Amendment, and some political journalists responded to the claims with incredulity.'Pence has long been one of Trump's most ardent defenders, and he has rarely broken with the president. The vice president has also continued to stick by his boss as the House's impeachment inquiry, centered on the president's call with the leader of Ukraine, heats up.Despite Pence's denial on Thursday, the Justice Department has sought information on the author ahead of the book's publication. Earlier this week, Assistant Attorney General Joseph Hunt wrote to the book's publisher and said details in the expos' may be violating the official's 'legal obligations under one or more nondisclosure agreements.''Such agreements typically require that any written work potentially containing protected information be submitted for pre-publication review,' Hunt wrote.Pence on Thursday called publication of 'A Warning' appalling and said if the author is still working for the administration, that person should 'do the honorable thing' and resign.'The very notion of this anonymous who wrote an editorial <U+2015> and now it's reported that they've written a book <U+2015> is just appalling to me,' he said.'A Warning' is set to be published on Nov. 19.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The White House instructed its officials not to comply with the investigation, which is looking at President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine.An official working on the inquiry said the House intelligence panel subpoenaed Mulvaney because other testimony indicated he 'could shed additional light on the president's abuse of the power of his office for his personal gain.'The person declined to be identified in order to discuss the confidential subpoena.Mulvaney said in a news conference last month that the Trump administration's decision to hold up military aid was linked to Trump's demand for the investigations. He later walked back his remarks, but Democrats said that was tantamount to a confession and have cited it as evidence in their inquiry.The subpoena comes after former national security adviser John Bolton failed to appear for an interview Thursday. Democrats say they will use the no-shows as evidence of the president's obstruction of Congress.Even though some of the most high-profile witnesses have failed to appear ' Energy Secretary Rick Perry also declined to show up this week ' Democrats have indicated they think they already have ample testimony about Trump's conduct on Ukraine. A slew of current and former officials from the State Department and White House have appeared over the last several weeks and largely corroborated the same narrative ' that Trump had delegated his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to guide U.S.-Ukraine policy and that the two men were focused on pressuring Ukraine as the administration withheld military aid from the country.One Democratic member of the intelligence panel, Washington Rep. Denny Heck, said Thursday that there is 'already a mountain of evidence' in the probe.'I think there's more evidence to the effect that the president shook down Ukraine, tried to cover it up, and threatened to and then withheld security assistance to Ukraine than there is evidence that the sun will come up in the East tomorrow,' Heck said.And witnesses have continued to come in. On Thursday, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence appeared under subpoena and was deposed for more than four hours.Jennifer Williams, a career foreign service officer detailed to Pence's office from the State Department, was one of several White House aides who were listening in on a July phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which Trump asked the new leader for the investigations, according to an administration official who requested anonymity to discuss the conversation.That call, in which Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his family as well as Ukraine's role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, is at the center of the'impeachment probe.Though Trump has said there was no 'quid pro quo,' several of the witnesses, including top Ukraine diplomat William Taylor, have testified that it was their understanding that Ukraine would not receive military assistance or a coveted Oval Office visit until it met the president's demands. A transcript of Taylor's closed-door deposition was released publicly Wednesday.Lawmakers leaving Williams' deposition said her testimony lined up with the accounts of others.'It just never ceases to amaze me how all of these people in every material aspect corroborate one another,' Heck said.Republican Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina said Williams was asked about Pence's September visit to Warsaw, Poland, where he met Zelinskiy. Pence has said he and the Ukrainian president did not discuss Biden during their closed-door meeting, but they did discuss the White House's decision to halt security aid meant to counter Russian aggression.Speaking to reporters in New Hampshire on Thursday, Pence stood by Trump and said if Americans read the administration's rough transcript of the call they will find 'there was no quid pro quo, the president did nothing wrong.' Pence called the impeachment inquiry a 'disgrace.'Investigators are wrapping up the private interviews as they prepare to start public hearings next week. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff announced Wednesday that three State Department witnesses will appear in two hearings next Wednesday and Friday: Taylor, career department official George Kent and Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Yovanovitch was ousted in May on Trump's orders and Taylor replaced her; both have testified about their concerns with the administration's policy on Ukraine.___Associated Press writers Jill Colvin, Eric Tucker, Matthew Lee and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Col. Alexander Vindman, who spoke to investigators last month as part of the impeachment'inquiry against President Donald Trump.Both Hill and Vindman raised concerns about Trump's dealings with Ukraine, saying that officials conditioned a White House meeting with Ukrainian leadership on whether or not the country launched an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.They specifically implicated acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.There was 'no ambiguity' about what the Ukrainians would have to do to secure the meeting, Vindman said.Hill served as the White House's chief Russia adviser for about two years before quitting in July. Vindman is currently the National Security Council's top Ukraine expert and has firsthand knowledge of the phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that kicked off the impeachment proceedings.The transcripts are the seventh and eighth to be released as the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees'prepare to host the inquiry's first public hearings'next week with three State Department officials who have already spoken with investigators privately.In a statement, committee chairs Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) said Hill and Vindman's 'superiors in the White House have declined to cooperate with the inquiry, but transcripts released today show clearly that individuals close to the president were alarmed by a presidential scheme as illicit and corrupt as a 'drug deal.''Following her deposition, Hill said she has been flooded with 'hateful calls and conspiracy theories.'Hill and her boss, Bolton, were reportedly so alarmed by Trump insiders' attempts to enact a shadow foreign policy with Ukraine that she alerted White House lawyers. Vindman, who previously reported to Hill, testified that he had also raised his concerns about Trump's dealings with Ukraine internally.Additionally, Hill told investigators that she considered Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, to be a security risk.Sondland has emerged as a key figure in the impeachment proceedings as investigators exposed his role in Trump's apparent effort to convince Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. He acknowledged in his testimony <U+2015> albeit through an addendum <U+2015> that the pitch included a quid pro quo: In exchange for announcing an investigation into Trump's political rivals, Ukraine would receive nearly $400 million in military aid.Both officials also said Mulvaney helped coordinate the quid pro quo efforts.'Ambassador Sondland, in front of the Ukrainians, as I came in, was talking about how he had an agreement with Chief of Staff Mulvaney for a meeting with the Ukrainians if they were going to go forward with investigations,' Hill said.'[Sondland] just said that he had had a conversation with Mr. Mulvaney, and this is what was required to get a meeting,' Vindman said, according to the transcript.Text messages between Sondland, former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and acting Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor revealed tension surrounding relations with the country. Ukraine is considered essential to American national security due to its proximity to Russia.Although the president has denied that a quid pro quo was ever on the table, Taylor told House investigators during his private testimony that it undoubtedly was.The entire mess between Trump and Ukraine was brought to light thanks to a bombshell whistleblower report filed back in August.The whistleblower, who has remained anonymous, was alarmed by a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Zelensky to 'do us a favor' by investigating the Bidens, saying his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani would be in touch.Details of Giuliani's shadow diplomacy have'prompted deep concerns'on both sides of the aisle.'In private and on national news, Giuliani has pushed'unsubstantiated allegations that Hunter Biden was involved in corruption in Ukraine, and that Joe Biden pushed for a Ukrainian prosecutor's firing in order to block an investigation into the corruption.Read Fiona Hill's and Lt.

'This effort by the House is a partisan revenge, sour grapes, sore loser effort by people who can't accept the fact they lost.'Graham did not address the details of the issue but instead joked: 'Trump told me, 'I didn't do no quid pro quo. I don't even speak Latin.''He did, though, acknowledge that Trump could 'be a handful' and quipped that he gets along well with Trump because they share a mutual interest. 'We found something in common. I like him, and he likes him. Which gives us a lot to talk about,' Graham said.Graham, a three-term senator from South Carolina who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, has become one of Trump's most vocal defenders on impeachment.When a rough transcript of a July 25 phone call was released showing Trump stating 'I would like you to do us a favor' after the Ukrainian president mentioned military aid, it caused dozens of Democratic House members and millions of Americans generally to switch from opposing impeachment to supporting it.'But Graham, a former Air Force lawyer, said he saw nothing inappropriate in Trump's request for a foreign country's investigation into the Democrat he most feared, former Vice President Joe Biden. More recently, Graham said he has no interest in reading the transcripts of the various administration officials whose under-oath testimony has corroborated a whistleblower's claim that Trump was coercing Ukraine to announce and conduct the investigations, using U.S. military aid as leverage.

"49",1440673039,"Vindman Says He Heard U.S. Envoy Explicitly Push For Investigation Of Bidens","WASHINGTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - An official on the White House's National Security Council said he heard the U.S. ambassador to the European Union explicitly press Ukrainian officials to investigate Joe Biden and his son, according to a transcript released on Friday by Democrats leading the impeachment probe of President Donald Trump.Alexander Vindman, a U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and Ukraine expert on the NSC, said Ambassador Gordon Sondland made it clear in a July 10 meeting at the White House that the investigations of the Bidens and Ukrainian gas company Burisma would have to be opened for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to get an Oval Office meeting with Trump.'He was calling for something, calling for an investigation that didn't exist into the Bidens and Burisma,' Vindman said. 'My visceral reaction to what was being called for suggested that it was explicit. There was no ambiguity.'His comments could give Democrats further ammunition in their push to determine whether Trump misused U.S. foreign policy to pressure Ukraine into carrying out a corruption probe into Democrat Joe Biden, a potential rival in the 2020 presidential election. The inquiry enters a critical phase next week when House committees hold impeachment hearings in public.Vindman was among the U.S. officials in the White HouseSituation Room monitoring Trump's call two weeks later on July 25 with Zelenskiy, a main focus of the impeachment probe.He said he had no doubt that Trump demanded that Ukraine open the investigations in return for an Oval Office visit for the Ukrainian leader.'This was about getting a White House meeting,' he said. 'It was a demand for him to... fulfill this particular prerequisite.'Vindman told lawmakers that he believes ties between theU.S. and Ukraine have been damaged by the administration's actions.'It undercuts U.S. resolve to support Ukraine and certainly puts a question into their mind whether they in fact have U.S.support,' he said.Also on Friday, an attorney for Trump's former NationalSecurity Adviser John Bolton sent a lawyer to House lawmakers that suggested Bolton knows about 'many relevant meetings and conversations' concerning Trump's actions toward Ukraine.Democrats have sought Bolton's testimony, but his lawyer,Charles Cooper, said in the letter that Bolton would not appear until a court rules on whether he should testify over objections from the White House.With public hearings getting underway, House Republicans made a move to bolster their response to the impeachment probe.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy announced thatRepresentative Jim Jordan, an aggressive Trump defender, had been assigned to the House Intelligence Committee.Vindman's account of the July 10 meeting at the White House was corroborated by Fiona Hill, the former senior director for European and Russian affairs on Trump's NSC.Hill testified she heard Sondland bring up Burisma at the meeting, according to a separate transcript of her testimony released on Friday.Vindman's testimony, in particular, highlighted fresh discrepancies of what occurred as recounted by Sondland, who told investigators he did not remember taking part in any effort to investigate the Bidens.Sondland, a Trump donor-turned-diplomat, acknowledged he encouraged Ukraine to investigate Burisma but said he did not know that Hunter Biden had served on the company's board.Vindman testified that Sondland told the July 10 gathering he coordinated the request with acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, who is Trump's top aide as well as the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget.Mulvaney was subpoenaed on Thursday night to testify but did not show up on Friday.Mark Sandy, associate director for national security programs at OMB, also was called to testify and did not appear.The White House previously has said it would not cooperate with the congressional investigation, which was triggered by a whistleblower complaint about a phone call on July 25 between Trump and Zelenskiy.Lawmakers wanted to question the two officials about their knowledge of OMB's decision last summer to block nearly $400 million in security aid for Ukraine that had been approved by lawmakers.Trump's defenders say there is no evidence of him and the Ukrainian president engaging in a quid pro quo - or exchanging a favor for a favor - because the aid to Ukraine was released and Zelenskiy never explicitly promised to investigate Burisma, the Bidens, or any Ukraine involvement in the 2016 election.A quid pro quo is not necessary, however, to prove high crimes or misdemeanors, which is the standard the U.S.Constitution requires for the impeachment of a president.Earlier on Friday, Trump said he was unconcerned about the impeachment inquiry and criticized House Democrats for moving their inquiry into the public eye with open, televised hearings next week.'They shouldn't be having public hearings; this is a hoax,'Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing, told reporters.The House committees conducting the inquiry are wrapping up the closed-door phase of their investigation before open hearings start next Wednesday with testimony from two diplomats who have been interviewed behind closed doors: William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, and Deputy Assistant Secretaryof State George Kent.Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was abruptly recalled by Trump in May, will testify on Nov. 15.(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle, Susan Cornwell, Makini Brice,Alexandra Alper and Susan Heavey; Additional reporting by Eric Beech and Mark Hosenball; Writing by Paul Simao and James Oliphant; Editing by Andy Sullivan and Alistair Bell)Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"52",1441132496,"Trump Says Ukraine Call Was ‘Perfect,’ And GOP Can’t Decide How To Defend Him","WASHINGTON (AP) ' Republicans have no unified argument in the impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump, in large part because they can't agree on how best to defend the president ' or for some, if they should.That would require a level of consensus that Trump's call with the Ukraine president was 'perfect,' as he insists. Or it would take a measure of GOP independence from Trump to suggest there may be a need to investigate.Instead, it's every Republican for himself or herself.Utah Sen. Mitt Romney says the president's actions toward Ukraine are 'troubling.' Other Republicans say the behavior may raise concerns, but it's not impeachable.South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham calls the whole impeachment inquiry 'B.S.'The result is a mishmash of GOP commentary spilling from Capitol Hill that may shield lawmakers, for now, from risky political choices, but leaves them with a disjointed defense of Trump as impeachment hearings push into the public realm this coming week.'It's not good,' said veteran GOP strategist Alex Conant. 'Normally you want to establish the facts, get them out on their own terms, and build a message around that strategy. They're not doing any of that.'He added: 'It's hard to rally people to your side without a coherent and sustainable message.'Early on, as the White House ceded the PR strategy to the president, Republicans in the House and Senate parted ways as they confronted the political threat posed by the Democrats' impeachment investigation.As far back as mid-October, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., gathered his GOP colleagues in private and offered them advice on impeachment.McConnell told Republican senators their best bet was to calibrate their own message about the impeachment inquiry to fit their political situation, according to two people familiar with the private meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door session.With a Power Point presentation, McConnell outlined the process ahead if the investigation moves to a vote in the House and trial in the Senate. But when it came time to broach what Republicans should say about impeachment, McConnell showed a preference for saying as little about it as possible.McConnell suggested a couple of options. Senators could say they disagreed with the House process, he said, or they could simply say that as potential jurors in an eventual impeachment trial they wouldn't discuss it, according to the people familiar with the meeting.It was the kind of political advice one would expect from the risk-averse leader as he tries to insulate his 53-seat GOP majority, including several senators up for reelection in 2020 in states such as Maine and Colorado where voters are split on Trump.'That's what a good leader does ' gives them the flexibility they need to respond. My problem is, given how egregious the president's conduct is, he's given them a pass,' said Jim Manley, a veteran Democratic strategist.'Most of these folks have got to know that what the president's doing is wrong, but they've made a cold-hearted, political decision right now it's best to stick with the president,' he said.At its core, the impeachment inquiry is based on what Democrats say is an improper quid pro quo ' a 'shakedown' ' that Trump engaged in during his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelesnkiy.According to a White House rough transcript of the call and testimony from several government officials, Trump was withholding needed military aid the East European ally as he wanted Zelenskiy to investigate Trump's potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden, as well 2016 U.S. election interference.In the House, where congressional district boundary lines have been drawn in a way that leaves Republicans barely exposed to voters with centrist or left-leaning views, GOP leaders are mounting a more fulsome, if shifting, defense of Trump.GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California says the president did nothing wrong on the call with Zelenskiy, and Trump's top allies in the House, including Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on a committee conducting the impeachment inquiry, are leading the daily arguments against Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and the Democrats.Jordan is seen as the 'chief messenger' for Republicans, said one senior House GOP aide who was not authorized to publicly discuss the strategy and spoke on condition of anonymity.The House Republican message against impeachment has four distinct parts, according to this aide: The transcript of Trump's call with Zelenskiy shows the president did nothing wrong; several key witnesses testified that they don't have firsthand knowledge of what transpired; the Ukrainians didn't know the military aid was being upheld until it was publicly reported; and eventually the U.S. agreed to send the money to Ukraine.It's a message being reinforced daily in the media by Jordan and other Trump surrogates, including Reps. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. and Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., who are also part of the inquiry panels, the person said.What goes without saying, though, is that few Republicans lawmakers are willing to say the call was 'perfect' or that there was 'no quid pro quo,' as Trump insists.More often, they say a little of this, a little of that.'There are perfectly appropriate quid pro quos and there are inappropriate quid pro quos,' offered Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. 'Just saying that there is a quid pro quo, at least based on my analysis of the evidence that I've seen so far, is a red herring.'___Associated Press video journalists Padmananda Rama and Dan Huff in Washington contributed to this report.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

YouTube announced a similar action.But Twitter said it would allow users to name the individual alleged to be the whistleblower, and to post photos of the individual, as long as the information doesn't include personal contact information. So Twitter has become the go-to platform for vicious attacks on the whistleblower that many say could endanger the individual's safety.The former head of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, asked Saturday why Twitter was failing to suspend accounts of people trying to 'get the whistleblower killed by naming the person they think it is.' He added that Twitter will be 'largely responsible if anything happens to this person.'.@jack - Why is Twitter failing in its responsibility to suspend accounts of people who are trying to get the whistleblower killed by naming the person they think it is? Twitter will be largely responsible if anything happens to this person. @TwitterSupportDo I sound pissed off that they're sending death threats to the whistleblower and my friend who represents him (and also happened to represent the Benghazi whistleblower)? You better believe I'm pissed off. These are terrorists. And the terrorist sympathizers are just as guilty.At least one person responding to Shaub said an account was taken down by Twitter after she complained about it. But others said repeated complaints about accounts naming the suspected whistleblower remain up despite being reported to Twitter.The MAGAs are posting the picture repeatedly and asking for Retweets, which of course they are obliging. I have reported many of them to no avail. This is dangerous to the Whistleblower as well as the family. @TwitterSafety @jack @TwitterSupport Do your Job or you are Complicit.Donald Trump Jr. posted the name of the person he believes it to be'on his Twitter account.

But Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), one of the Democrats leading the impeachment probe, strongly suggested Saturday that the whistleblower would not be called to do so, reiterating Democrats' commitment to protecting the person's identity.Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a letter to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the committee's top Republican, that the whistleblower's testimony would be 'redundant and unnecessary' given the mounting evidence corroborating the whistleblower's complaint. CNN published Schiff's letter on Saturday night.'The impeachment inquiry ' has gathered an ever-growing body of evidence <U+2015> from witnesses and documents, including the President's own words in his July 25 call record <U+2015> that not only confirms, but far exceeds, the initial information in the whistleblower's complaint,' Schiff wrote.

"55",1441558085,"Former Trump Adviser John Bolton Lands Book Deal, Sources Say","NEW YORK (AP) ' Former national security adviser John Bolton has a book deal, The Associated Press has learned.The hawkish Bolton departed in September because of numerous foreign policy disagreements with President Donald Trump. He reached a deal over the past few weeks with Simon & Schuster, according to three publishing officials with knowledge of negotiations. The officials were not authorized to discuss the deal publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Two of the officials said the deal was worth about $2 million. Bolton was represented by the Javelin literary agency, whose clients include former FBI Director James Comey and the anonymous Trump administration official whose book, 'A Warning,' comes out Nov. 19.The publishing officials did not know the title or release date. Simon & Schuster declined comment Saturday and Javelin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bolton's 2007 book, 'Surrender is Not an Option: Defending America at the United Nations and Abroad,' was published by the conservative Simon & Schuster imprint Threshold Editions.Bolton's name has come up often recently during the House impeachment inquiry, which has focused on Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate potential 2020 election rival Joe Biden, the former vice president.In a transcript of a closed-door interview released Friday, a former national security official described how Bolton had 'immediately stiffened' as Ambassador Gordon Sondland 'blurted out' that he had worked out a trade ' Ukrainians' probe for an Oval Office welcome for Ukraine's new president ' with Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.Fiona Hill said Bolton later told her that 'I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up' and asked her to relay that message to a White House lawyer.Meanwhile, a letter from Bolton's attorney to the top lawyer for the House alleges that Bolton was 'part of many relevant meetings and conversations' pertaining to the House impeachment inquiry of Trump that are not yet public.The attorney, Charles Cooper, suggests Bolton will appear before Congress only if a judge orders him to do so.Appointed in April 2018, Bolton was Trump's third national security adviser and is known for advocating military action abroad, a viewpoint Trump has resisted. In a speech in late September to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, given after he left the administration, Bolton offered a far more aggressive approach to North Korea's nuclear program than the one advocated by Trump, who has spoken warmly about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.'Every day that goes by makes North Korea a more dangerous country,' Bolton said. 'You don't like their behavior today, what do you think it will be when they have nuclear weapons that can be delivered to American cities?'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

'These witnesses should come public and, you know, the American people should judge for themselves, as well as we will, as to what happened here.'Like Swalwell, Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, used the term 'extortion' rather than 'quid pro quo' on Sunday to describe Trump's actions.'I have two problems with 'quid pro quo,'' Himes told NBC's 'Meet The Press.''Number one: When you are trying to persuade the American people of something really pretty simple, which is that the president acted criminally and extorted ' in the way a mob boss would extort somebody ' a vulnerable foreign country, it's probably best not to use Latin words to explain it,' he said.The second point, he added, is that 'extortion doesn't require a 'you give me this and I'll give you that' kind of quid pro quo. It simply requires using your muscle to get something that you don't have a right to.'Though Republicans are united in defending Trump against the ongoing impeachment inquiry, their strategies for doing so have differed.'Some are saying there wasn't a quid pro quo.

Lindsey Graham and the Ukraine scandal. #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/7yHxLUXUhpTapper showed a video clip of Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, stating in September that there was no evidence of a quid pro quo between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as a U.S. intelligence official suggested in a whistleblower complaint filed in August.After the White House released a rough transcript of Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky, Graham said it would be 'very disturbing' if there was evidence Trump engaged in a quid pro quo outside the call.'We now have reams of evidence,' Tapper said Sunday, as the camera showed him patting a stack of papers, 'testimony from multiple Trump administration diplomats and national security officials <U+2015> current and former <U+2015> suggesting that outside that phone call ... all were pushing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens if they wanted that aid and that White House meeting.'But Graham suddenly has a 'brand-new take' on the matter, according to Tapper. He then showed a video clip of the Republican senator calling Trump's Ukraine policy 'incoherent' and suggesting he was 'incapable of forming a quid pro quo.''Coherence is not particularly evident in Chairman Graham's position on this impeachment inquiry,' Tapper said.Graham called on Democrats last month to release transcripts of the private testimonies provided by witnesses during the impeachment inquiry. When they did, Graham told reporters he wouldn't read the transcripts anyway.'I don't care what anybody else says about the phone call,' he said Tuesday. 'The phone call <U+2015> I've made up my own mind <U+2015> is fine.'Tapper said CNN invited Graham to appear Sunday on 'State of the Union,' but the senator's office told the network he was 'unavailable.' Graham did appear Sunday morning on Fox News, giving an interview to Maria Bartiromo, one of Trump's most vocal supporters.During the interview, Graham pushed his unsubstantiated theory that the whistleblower, whose identity has not been confirmed, is a member of the so-called deep state, a right-wing conspiracy theory that a network of bureaucrats within the government are working to undermine Trump.He claimed the 'only reason' the public doesn't know the whistleblower's identity is because Democrats believe it would 'hurt their cause.' The whistleblower is protected by the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, which shields a federal worker who reports government corruption or wrongdoing from retaliatory actions.A representative for Graham did not immediately respond to HuffPost's request for comment.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

'I really do. I think he'd be, he'd be railing against what's going on.'When the senator was alive, she argued, he made it possible for other GOP lawmakers to stand up to Trump rather than having to stay in line for fear of losing support back home.'I think John provided a lot of cover for other members, and when he would do it, they could get behind him,' she said. 'I'm not seeing a real rudder in the Senate right now in all this.'John McCain died at age 81 in 2018 after a battle with brain cancer.

Bondy'told The New York Times in a report published Sunday.Also contingent on the investigation announcement reportedly was Vice President Mike Pence's attendance at Zelensky's inauguration ceremony, according to Bondy. Pence never ended up attending Zelensky's inauguration, according to the Times.The remarks to the newspaper are one of the first signs that Parnas has flipped on Trump and his personal attorney in the impeachment investigation surrounding the United States president's attempted extortion of Ukraine. The warning to Ukrainian leadership was allegedly at the direction of Giuliani, whom Bondy said Parnas believed to be acting under Trump's instruction.The business associate said Nov. 4 that'he would be willing to testify in the House impeachment probe, a change of heart after Parnas refused to comply with House committees' requests in October. The reconsideration came after Trump denied to reporters that he knew Parnas.Parnas and fellow Soviet-born business associate Igor Fruman were arrested in October'on charges of using a shell company to make straw donations to a pro-Trump election committee and other Republican candidates'like former Rep. Pete Sessions (Texas). They pleaded not guilty, though the indictments did not mention any issues related to the impeachment investigation.Giuliani has said that Parnas and Fruman assisted him in pursuing unsubstantiated allegations that Biden pushed for a Ukrainian prosecutor's ouster to benefit his son Hunter, who used to serve on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. But Giuliani has denied that Parnas delivered a warning to incoming Ukrainian leadership at his direction, according to the Times.Giuliani himself'is under investigation over allegations'of illegally engaging in foreign lobbying in connection with the Ukraine scandal. That investigation stemmed from the probe into Parnas and Fruman, though Giuliani has denied any wrongdoing.Fruman's attorney John M. Dowd told the Times that the two were only seeking a meeting with Zelensky and that there was no discussion of withholding military aid or setting up terms.Trump suspended nearly $400 million in congressionally approved U.S. military aid to Ukraine just before his July 25 call with Zelensky, in which he pressured him to investigate the Bidens as well as false claims that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election instead of Russia.The House announced an impeachment inquiry into Trump in September after reviewing a whistleblower complaint about the Ukraine call.

He has urged PBS to rebroadcast the hearings during prime time so that they more easily be seen by working people.'Do facts matter anymore?' Moyers asked, referring to the impeachment investigation. 'I think they do. I think they mattered in the Watergate hearings, in the Clinton hearings, and I think they'll matter this time, too.''He referred to Trump's 'astonishing' response from the crowd at a campaign rally last month in Louisiana.'They believed everything he said,' Moyers noted. 'I'm hoping only 10% of those people watch the hearings ... They will see it is not a witch hunt, and they will begin to doubt their master. And they will begin to break off and maybe become a citizen again.'Moyers believes Trump still has a 'pretty good' chance of winning the 2020 election, but that only a 'slight shift' in people who 'begin to doubt' could make a significant difference.Check out Moyers' remarks in the clip above.Next week, the House Intelligence Committee will hold its first open hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry.On Wednesday, November 13, 2019, we will hear from William Taylor and George Kent.On Friday, November 15, 2019, we will hear from Marie Yovanovitch.More to come.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"65",1442543853,"Why ‘Watchmen’ Is The Best Kind Of Confusing","'Watchmen,' a new HBO series created by Damon Lindelof ('Lost,' 'The Leftovers'), is set about three decades after the 1986 comic book series in an alternate reality where Robert Redford is president and baby cephalopods fall from the sky. Though based on the comic, the TV show remixes the superhero saga to explore racial injustice, policing, politics and family.Some characters do return, including Agent Laurie Blake (Jean Smart), the former second'Silk Spectre, and Adrian Veidt (Jeremy Irons), aka Ozymandias, once one of the richest people in the world and also the person who secretly sent a giant squid to kill half of New York in the '80s in order to avert nuclear war. (We know, it's a lot to untangle; here's a deeper'explainer if you're confused.) However, the first four episodes of 'Watchmen' focus mostly on a twisty story about new characters in Tulsa, Oklahoma.A war is brewing in Tulsa between the mask-wearing white supremacist group known as the Seventh Kavalry and the also-mask-wearing cops trying to keep the peace. With everyone wearing masks, detective Angela Abar (Regina King), aka Sister Night, finds it nearly impossible to tell the good guys from the bad. The arrival of Will Reeves (Louis Gossett Jr.), a mysterious figure in a wheelchair who is tied to Abar's past, complicates things even more. There's also a trillionaire, Lady Trieu (Hong Chau), who seems to be able to predict the future and is building a giant clock for reasons yet unknown.With so much going on, HuffPost's Bill Bradley and Erin Evans decided to unmask some of the storylines on 'Watchmen' so you could decide the ultimate question: Should you watch it?Because 'Watchmen' isn't just a straightforward adaptation of the comic series/graphic novel, it gives both fans and newcomers something surprising around every corner. The series shines a light on class and racial injustice at one moment and then, somehow, showcases a giant blue vibrator by the end of the episode (and then puts the'blueprints online). Viewers who stick around will be rewarded with a modern-day superhero mystery that'll leave them questioning everything.Erin Evans:'OK, so admittedly, I didn't know anything about 'Watchmen' before it aired. And I only decided to watch it because I will watch Regina King open an envelope on TV. I've loved her since '227.' But the very first scene, about the Tulsa Race Massacre, immediately drew me in. I've read a lot about Greenwood, the city neighborhood known as Black Wall Street, but had never seen it portrayed on TV or film. Seeing this, in the guise of a comic book adaptation, hooked me.'Bill Bradley:'The Tulsa Race Massacre opening was harrowing, especially because going into it, if you're a fan of the comic, you may be aware the real world and the comic world of 'Watchmen' split in 1938. But the show makes it clear right away this is 1921, so immediately you're like, 'Wow. This is real.' The whole series has clear comic tie-ins, but I kind of like that whether you know the comics or you don't know it at all, everyone's confused about what's going on.Erin:'Right. If you're like me and have no clue about the comic book series, it was helpful to do a little Googling after each episode. There are so many characters and masks and references to things that don't make any sense. I mean, it is all based on an alternate history, like the comics. And from what I've read about creator Damon Lindelof and executive producer Nicole Kassell, they intended for it not to be an adaptation but an actual reimagining of the comics. Truly innovative and speaks to the cultural moment we're in right now.Bill:'You mentioned this the other day, but Donald Trump tweeting that the impeachment inquiry was a lynching and then to have a show on right now that displays the actual horrors of mob justice is wild. The fact that it shined such a light on the Tulsa massacre <U+2015> the show is already a success. And then every once in a while you get a baby being pulled out of a lake or a giant blue vibrator.Erin:'That blue vibrator was huge. But it didn't confuse me as much as the squid shower in the middle of Episode 1.Bill:'Yeah, I think the main takeaway I got from that is I'm glad I'm only allergic to shrimp. If it was a shrimp shower, I'd be a goner. Squid, I can handle. The squid shower is obviously one of those comic tie-ins. And I love a show with questions.Erin:'Louis Gossett Jr.! So good. Jeremy Irons as Veidt is weird AF and I kinda still haven't figured out what's going on with him. My boyfriend-in-my-head Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is whew! as Regina King's husband. I love their partnership. What performances have stood out for you?Bill:'I really think there's something going on with your bf Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. Like, is he secretly Doctor Manhattan? Idk. They are both super buff. Listing out great performances in the show is like just listing off the IMDb page. Regina King, Jean Smart, Tim Blake Nelson, Louis Gossett Jr. and Tom Mison, who has to show his blue pee-pee, all great. But I also want to take a moment to recognize Panda, aka Jacob Ming-Trent. Panda's got a tough job being the person in charge of whether or not the cops can use their guns. Nobody seems to like him, but he's true to himself. And he wears a panda mask, hence the name. We need more people like Panda.Erin:'Jean Smart! Her character is really compelling and she's like straight out of the comics, kinda, sorta, right? In Episodes 3 and 4, she really helps reel in the graphic novel fans with callbacks to the series, at least from what I recall from reading on the internet, LOL.Bill:'Yeah, also, for people who are overly confused, 'Watchmen' kind of ingeniously gives us Agent Petey, who somewhat feels like a surrogate comic-loving audience'member and fills in a lot of the background information from the comic that you need to know. There's also a site called Peteypedia that further explains everything going on with the world offscreen, much like the 1986 comics had supplemental material.Erin: Peteypedia! Wow, I'm just now realizing they uploaded more content since the first episode. See, I'm missing out on crucial information. Petey has been trying to help me all along.Bill:'For Pete's sake, Erin! With so much going on, is there anything about the series that's not connecting with you?'Erin:'I'm largely still confused most of the time. But that doesn't make me like the show any less. I love going on a ride for a show like this that gets at race, family and some weird stuff in between. Also, the episode explainers online ' like the one you wrote after Episode 1 ' have been really helpful.Bill:'Right. I'm all about shows I can get invested in. The early seasons of 'Game of Thrones' were great, for instance, because you could theorize about the meanings behind every little thing. Like, what do those'crazy spirals in 'Game of Thrones' actually mean? And of course, we found out, oh, they mean nothing because the showrunners just never addressed it. No payoff is such a letdown. The 'Game of Thrones' spirals were really just all my theories spiraling down into the toilet. For 'Watchmen,' we've been promised a payoff by the show creators, but so far it's TBD.Erin:'The show really is a mystery. The storytelling is really great, but I almost wish it wasn't based on a graphic novel. It makes me think every little thing means something and that I need to find an answer to it, which can be a little annoying. Everyone is dissecting every little thing and I just want to enjoy the ride. I also wonder if I'd like it better if I could just stream the whole season over a weekend. I love a binge and this could work in that format, too.Bill:'Yeah, a downside to shows you can get invested in is you need to invest in them or else what the heck are you even doing. I like 'Watchmen' and want to invest time in it. But sometimes it can feel a bit like work, and I mean other than this being my job.Erin:'Absolutely. It's a captivating show that taps into so many current conversations about our society, around race, policing and history, with an immense amount of intrigue. Plus, you can't deny Regina King.Bill:'The show tackles race in a way that feels so relevant to right now and also showcases alien squid showers and lake babies that look like Lord Voldemort. I say, 'Watch, man.'",2019-11-11 14:54:14

Two sources who overheard the conversation provided a recording to CNN'on the condition the recording not be made public.Christiann' Allen, a spokeswoman for Giuliani, confirmed to CNN that he did discuss the podcast idea at lunch on Saturday.''He is considering several options, in consultation with Jay Sekulow and the legal team, regarding the best way to move forward,' she said. 'As of now, they have not decided on the strategy but are getting very close.'Giuliani is being investigated by federal prosecutors'in New York over his ties to two men, now charged with campaign finance violations,'who allegedly aided his efforts to advance Trump's interests in Ukraine. He has also been subpoenaed as part of the House's impeachment probe into Trump's alleged efforts to coerce the Ukrainian government into investigating 2020 political rival Joe Biden.The closed-door testimony of several witnesses has already described Giuliani as having a central role in the conversations and decisions by Trump and Trump officials that sparked the impeachment inquiry. He is also notoriously loose-lipped and a repeat butt-dialer, which would seem to make a podcast <U+2015> not to mention the whole relationship <U+2015> a bit risky for Trump.Most notably, Giuliani'accidentally rang an NBC journalist twice in three weeks last month, at one point leaving a three-minute message in which he could be heard speaking about needing cash and ranting about Biden, according to NBC News. Other journalists'say they've had similar experiences.Since the beginning of the impeachment inquiry, Giuliani has made appearances on multiple networks arguing with news hosts and ranting about Biden conspiracy theories. In an explosive September'interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo, he denied asking Ukraine to investigate Biden, got into a yelling match with Cuomo, and then minutes later admitted, 'Of course I did,' when asked the same question.So the news that Giuliani might create an impeachment podcast had Twitter users in a tizzy.

If I were a Democrat in the House, which I am not and never will be, I would vote to impeach,' he said. He also said Republicans are going to find some of Trump's behavior 'difficult to defend.'Napolitano, a former judge, denounced Trump on his Fox Nation subscription show 'Liberty File,' criticizing the president's apparent failure to follow the law, the Constitution, or norms of procedure in the White House.'In nearly three years in office, President Donald Trump has spent federal dollars not authorized by Congress; separated families and incarcerated children at the Texas-Mexico border in defiance of a federal court order; pulled 1,000 American troops out of Syria, ignoring a commitment to allies ... and sent 2,000 American troops to Saudi Arabia without a congressional authorization or declaration of war,' Napolitano recounted.'The former judge also said Trump has 'criminally obstructed a Department of Justice investigation of himself,' apparently referring to the investigation by former special counsel Robert Mueller. The president 'escaped prosecution because of the intercession of an attorney general more loyal to him than to the Constitution,' Napolitano said.fox nation is not just for over the top pro-trump takes, it is also for dissent too real to air on fox news pic.twitter.com/DOpnTE6P5DNapolitano noted that Trump has also called the Constitution's'emoluments clause''phony.' The clause prohibits federal officeholders from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments. It's designed to prevent the president from being influenced by foreign entities to the detriment of America's interests.Trump's remark was a 'disparagement of the Constitution he is sworn to uphold, and ' at the worst ' a threat to ignore other clauses that he can disparage,' Napolitano said. He added: 'This is most unusual and potentially dangerous in a president.''Can the president of the United States lawfully enforce only the clauses of the Constitution with which he agrees, and ignores those with which he disagrees?

Joe Biden is a leading rival to Trump in the 2020 presidential race.At the time the contract to his donors was awarded, the former Texas governor was negotiating with Ukraine about a White House meeting with Trump that Zelensky was seeking, officials have testified in the House impeachment inquiry.Military aid for the nation had been approved by Congress but was being held up by Trump. The president pressed Zelensky in a July phone call to launch an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden because of vague, baseless claims of corruption.

Trump eventually released the aid, but only after Republicans urged him to do so and a whistleblower filed a complaint about the matter.But Haley suggested Trump's intentions are irrelevant because he didn't get what he wanted anyway.'You've got a situation where there was no investigation and the aid flowed as it was supposed to,' she said. 'So when you look at that situation, it's hard to see where impeachment would qualify.'Guthrie quickly fired back: 'Can I stop you right there?

'It's just not a good practice.''Having said that, there's no insistence on that call, there are no demands on that call,' she continued.

'It's wrong whether it's a Republican president or a Democratic president.'Tillerson has denied Haley's claims that he sought to undermine Trump. Kelly told The Washington Post that he's 'guilty as charged' if 'working against Trump' means providing the president with the 'best and most open, legal and ethical staffing advice from across the [government] so he could make an informed decision.'Asked Tuesday if she ever questioned Trump's fitness for office or his mental acuity, Haley said 'never.''I never had any concern about whether he could handle the job,' she said.

"76",1443443882,"Don’t Get Confused By The Ukraine Scandal: Here Are The Key Facts","It seems like the Ukraine scandal keeps getting more and more complicated. There are questions over process, transcripts coming out and excuses by President Donald Trump's allies muddying the facts.But in reality, it all remains very simple <U+2015> as simple as when the whistleblower complaint first came out. Making the'entire scandal seem messy and complicated is exactly what Trump and his allies are aiming to do in advance of this week's first House hearings in the impeachment investigation.'Here are the key facts:'Trump manipulated U.S. foreign policy for his own political benefit. On July 25, Trump had a call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to a White House-released transcript, Trump said he wanted Ukraine to investigate two matters: first, whether Ukrainians were involved in the 2016 election hack of the Democratic National Committee, and second, Vice President Joe Biden's role in preventing an investigation into Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company whose board his son sat on. ''There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,''Trump told Zelensky. 'Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it.''Both Trump's assertion about Biden'and his claim that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election are conspiracy theories.A week before Trump had his call with Zelensky, Trump told his chief of staff to hold back $400 million in military aid for Ukraine, which had been approved by Congress.William Taylor, who was the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, confirmed to House lawmakers that Trump blocked the aid and refused to meet with Zelensky until he secured a promise that Ukraine would investigate the Bidens. Taylor took notes from his time in the position, backing up his account.''That was my clear understanding, security assistance money would not come until the president committed to pursue the investigation,' Taylor said.'Trump ally Gordon Sondland, a donor who became U.S. ambassador to the European Union, also confirmed that he told a top Ukrainian official that the country would have to go along with Trump's demands'to get the financial assistance. (Sondland, however, had initially told investigators that he 'never' thought there was a precondition on the aid.)'Trump has insisted he withheld aid because he wanted Ukraine to more aggressively root out corruption.'Corruption is incredible in Ukraine, which bothered me a lot,' Trump said this month. 'And it also bothered me very, very much that Germany, France and all of these other countries aren't putting up money, but we're always the sucker that does it.'But that claim doesn't stand up to scrutiny: Ukraine was already taking anti-corruption steps and European nations outpace the United States in spending on Ukraine.'There were no sensitive national security secrets in Trump's call with Zelensky. But nevertheless, the White House moved the transcript of the call to a highly classified server, making it harder for other officials to access it and know what was said.'Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine adviser at the White House, had been listening to the July 25 call and was disturbed by what he heard. When he shared his concerns with White House lawyer John Eisenberg, Eisenberg proposed moving the transcript to the separate system. In other words, the focus was on hiding the evidence rather than confronting what had happened.It's not clear what, if any, role Trump had in this cover-up.'A central figure in this scandal is Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer. Giuliani does not work in the White House and has no government job. Yet he was running his own foreign policy operation, apparently with Trump's blessing, and pushing the Biden conspiracy theory.John Bolton, then the national security adviser, reportedly called Giuliani a 'hand grenade' and called the effort to pressure Ukraine for political purposes a 'drug deal.'In Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, he repeatedly asked the Ukrainian president to work with Giuliani <U+2015> even though, again, Giuliani did not serve in government.Two of Giuliani's associates in his campaign to pressure Ukraine were indicted on federal campaign finance charges in October.'Giuliani was also a main driver in getting rid of Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, because she was seen as an obstacle to getting Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.There's been a significant amount of speculation by Trump's conservative allies about the identity of the whistleblower, with some right-wing outlets trying to push the media to publish the name of the person they believe is the author of the bombshell memo.'But at this point, the memo <U+2015> and its author <U+2015> are almost irrelevant. The whistleblower admitted to hearing about the phone call and what happened from other White House officials but did not witness it. The complaint was meant to be a roadmap for Congress to pursue further investigation.Other individuals with firsthand knowledge of the call have since confirmed what the whistleblower originally wrote.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"77",1443485562,"The Impeachment Of Donald Trump Is Starting. Here’s What To Know.","The first public impeachment hearings for President Donald Trump will begin on Wednesday, as Congress launches a high-profile interrogation of a critical question: Did Trump withhold military aid from Ukraine in an effort to force the country's government to open an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden?The televised hearings will start off with top officials who have previously testified to House impeachment investigators behind closed doors, and who added support to an anonymous whistleblower complaint from August that alleged the Trump administration attempted to engage in a quid pro quo arrangement with Ukraine. It may also be a stage for Republicans to take extreme measures to push back against impeachment, as they did weeks earlier when they tried to storm the private impeachment hearings.'Acting ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and senior State Department official George Kent will all testify this week. Taylor and Kent will be first up on Wednesday, followed by Yovanovitch on Friday.The House Intelligence Committee, led by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), will hold the hearings. Both Schiff and ranking Republican member of the committee Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) will make opening statements before questioning witnesses. Schiff and Nunes will each get 45-minute periods to ask witnesses as many questions as they want. Once these are over, other committee members will get five minutes to ask their own questions.Taylor, a career diplomat who Democrats are presenting as a star witness, will be the first to testify. His testimony during the closed-door impeachment inquiry was one of the most damning for Trump, and he has served under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Taylor was the top official in Ukraine during the alleged quid pro quo scandal and Trump's pressuring of Ukrainian officials.Taylor effectively told investigators that the Trump administration had pursued a quid pro quo arrangement, saying that he had learned from other top officials that Trump was withholding $391 million in military aid and a White House visit unless Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky publicly committed to investigating Biden and his son.'Security assistance money would not come until the president [of Ukraine] committed to pursue the investigation,' Taylor said in his initial testimony.'House Democrats also released a series of text messages last month in which Taylor told U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland that 'it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.'Kent is a deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs who oversaw the State Department's Ukraine policy. He testified during private hearings that Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani were running a shadow policy in Ukraine that excluded State Department officials and undermined U.S. interests. Kent alleged that Trump wanted Zelensky to 'go to the microphone' and explicitly mention an investigation into Biden. He alleged that Giuliani had led a smear campaign against Yovanovitch to force her ouster.Yovanovitch is the former ambassador to Ukraine who alleged that Trump abruptly ousted her from the position in April after a 'concerted campaign' against her from Trump allies including Giuliani. Although Yovanovitch lost her ambassador position in April, before the whistleblower complaint, her initial testimony provided information on Giuliani's growing involvement in Ukraine and the campaign to oust her.''Republicans have struggled to settle on a coherent defense against many of the allegations facing Trump and White House officials, but conservative lawmakers and pundits have found a few consistent talking points as the public hearings are set to begin.'A common line of attack has been to try and discredit witnesses as either politically motivated or only working with secondhand knowledge of events. Republicans have also focused on trying to undermine the anonymous whistleblower, accusing them of bias against Trump.Republicans also shuffled the lineup of the House Intelligence Committee to add Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) in preparation for the hearings. Jordan is an outspoken Trump defender who has repeatedly attacked the impeachment inquiry and additionally called for the anonymous whistleblower's name to be made public.The Constitution doesn't give those facing impeachment the same rights as criminal defendants. The worst punishment Trump could face is losing his job. Trump's attorneys will be allowed to take on more of a role once the proceeding moves to the House Judiciary Committee once the House Intelligence Committee's hearings are finished. Trump will also have a chance to defend himself during any proceeding in the Senate, the Republican-controlled body which will ultimately decide on whether to remove the president from office.'Although a lot of' this information is already known, it's a chance for Democrats to highlight what Trump has done wrong and simplify a byzantine story. And it will be only the third time in modern American history that the U.S. holds public presidential impeachment hearings.Ryan Reilly contributed reporting to this article.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The matter is at the center of House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into the president, which arose after the public learned Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens based on those unfounded claims. The White House was withholding American military aid from the country at the time, raising questions that the president attempted a quid pro quo.Jill Biden called Trump's dealings with Ukraine''flat out wrong.''The fact that he attacked my son, I have never seen that in other elections, that they go after children of the candidate,' she said.She then delivered a direct message to the president: 'Stop it.

"79",1443553865,"The Democratic Primary Is Still Mostly About Health Care","Impeachment proceedings may be dominating the headlines, but Democratic voters are far more likely to care about health care, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds <U+2015> and most also say it's among the issues they're hearing discussed most on the campaign trail.About half of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say they've heard candidates mention impeachment within the last month, compared to the nearly 7 in 10 who've heard mention of health care.'But the 62% who name health care as among the issues getting the most play in the campaign eclipses the share who see a similar focus on any other topic. Roughly a quarter name impeachment, gun policies and the environment as being among the most-mentioned issues, with nothing else breaking above 20%.The sentiments expressed in the poll echo reports from the campaign trail, where virtually none of voters' questions to the candidates have focused on impeachment and only a minority have been about President Donald Trump. One possible reason, as The New York Times' Reid Epstein notes, is that the Democratic hopefuls all more or less support the impeachment inquiry. By contrast, there are significant differences among the candidates' visions for the health care system <U+2015> and those differences have been highlighted, if not always illuminated, by the primary debates.About half of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters want to see the candidates talk more about health care and the environment, the HuffPost/YouGov survey finds, with few wanting to hear less about either issue. Voters are more divided on impeachment, with 23% saying they'd like to hear more and 22% saying that they'd like to hear less about it.'As was the case during the 2018 midterm elections, Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters also overwhelmingly choose health care as being among the issues that matter most to them. Sixty-two percent say health care is one of their three top issues for next year's primary, with 42% picking the environment, followed by gun policies (29%), the economy (25%), impeachment (20%), immigration (18%), social issues (16%), voting rights (11%) and abortion policy (10%). Fewer than 1 in 10 picked any of the other issues listed, including foreign policy, corporate regulation, tax reform or the Supreme Court.Like any poll, this one should be read with a couple of caveats. For one, surveys on top issues can vary considerably based on the set of options respondents are provided with. For another, not every voter who picks 'health care' as a top issue will mean the same thing; some might be worried about rising costs, while others could be expressing their support for (or opposition to) a plan like 'Medicare for All.' And last, voters' propensity to care about an issue doesn't necessarily mean they'll end up deciding whom to vote for because of it.'But what voters say they care most about, and which political messages are best breaking through, can help shed light on an election's dynamics. In the latest poll, 72% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say the candidates are addressing the issues and topics that matter to them at least somewhat well, with 30% saying they're doing so very well. By contrast, 41% of all registered voters say Democratic candidates are addressing their issues at least somewhat well.'Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:'The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Nov. 6-7 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

"81",1443557721,"Trump Won Iowa Easily In 2016, But His Trade War Is Putting It In Play For 2020","COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa <U+2015> Jeff Jorgensen is the kind of guy the president can count on.The co-chairman of the Pottawattamie County Republican Party calls Donald Trump the greatest president of his lifetime and the impeachment proceedings against him 'a hoax.' Jorgensen has taken to leading protests in front of the Council Bluffs office of the Democratic congresswoman who voted to support the impeachment investigation.'Donald Trump is being harassed,' he said after a recent gathering of the county GOP's central committee in an austere meeting room of the local library. 'If they want to get rid of the guy, let's have the election.'In Iowa, Jorgensen has plenty of company. At the state GOP's annual Lincoln-Reagan Dinner last week, hundreds of local party activists like him cheered and whooped when keynote speaker and Trump's most vocal Senate defender Lindsey Graham predicted, 'Donald Trump is going to kick their ass.'But Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina, also offered this quiet warning: 'If we keep Iowa, it all works. If we lose Iowa, it don't work.'It was a sober moment in an evening otherwise celebrating Trump's willingness to fill the federal courts with conservative judges 'as far as the eye can see' while slashing taxes and business regulations. Iowa, with only six electoral votes, is uniquely positioned to thwart Trump's goal of a second term <U+2015> an outcome that at this moment is looking possible, even promising, for Democrats.Recent polling shows Trump's approval ratings in the low 40s in the state. In last year's midterm elections, Democrats flipped two Republican House seats, thanks largely to a surge of anti-Trump voters in the Des Moines suburbs and smaller cities.'I think there's opportunity here. We saw that here in '18,' said Matt Paul, a consultant who ran eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's caucus operation in the state in 2016.That opportunity could become even more enticingly real if Trump continues his trade war with China and other countries, Paul said, because the retaliatory tariffs have hammered Iowa's farmers, slashing their income and increasing bankruptcies.'They're looking for permission to support a Democrat,' Paul said of farmers and others in rural communities who depend on a healthy agricultural economy. 'From a policy standpoint, he's setting this up beautifully for us.'It's a danger that Graham, for one, recognized clearly in his speech: 'To the Iowa farmer, hang in there. It's going to get better.'Jessica Borrer and Anna Shoeman remember caucus night 2016 clearly. The two sisters were supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic contest, and people around them were grumbling: If Sanders didn't win, they were going to vote for Trump or not vote at all.'They hated Hillary for some reason,' said Shoeman, a 39-year-old loan underwriter for Wells Fargo.Nearly four years later, as they waited with their mother to enter Saturday's Sanders rally at Drake University in Des Moines, the sisters didn't know if those particular caucus-goers had followed through on their threats.A significant number, though, apparently did. A full 13% of male Democratic voters in Iowa supported Trump, compared to 9% nationally. In all, Clinton won just 88% of Iowa Democrats in 2016, while then-President Barack Obama had won 95% of them four years earlier. The result: Iowa went from supporting Obama in 2012 by 6 percentage points to backing Trump in 2016 by 10 points. Among the six states that flipped from Obama to Trump, Iowa had the largest swing, bigger even than Ohio's 11 points.Yet two years later, enough Iowans had soured on Trump that two of the state's three congressional House seats in Republican hands were won by Democrats: Abby Finkenauer in the district that covers northeast Iowa and Cindy Axne in the district that covers the southwestern part of the state, including Council Bluffs.That anti-Trump backlash appears to continue today. Besides the recent surveys showing his approval rating in the low 40s, an Emerson College poll from last month found Trump essentially tied in head-to-head matchups with the three top Democratic candidates: former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Sanders.Perhaps more important for the eventual Democratic nominee, even Sanders' supporters appear to recognize the need to consolidate behind that person if the goal is to deny Trump a second term.Isaac Brondsun, a 19-year-old Grinnell College student, said he understands that much of that burden falls on his cohort, the stereotypical young, white, male 'Bernie Bro' who wound up voting for Trump or Green Party nominee Jill Stein or no one at all in 2016. 'Now that we see what Donald Trump has done, maybe they'll see the importance of voting against him,' Brondsun said as he waited to enter the Sanders event.Wade Lester, an apprentice electrician with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local in Des Moines, said many of his fellow union members cast ballots for Trump three years ago after caucusing for Sanders 10 months earlier. 'They believed what Trump said in his speeches, and now none of that is happening, so they aren't going to vote for him again,' Lester said. 'And some of them won't even admit they voted for him the last time.'Two nights earlier, at the Pottawattamie Republicans meeting, Jorgensen announced that he would stage another impeachment protest in front of Rep. Axne's district office. Only this time, he said, he would ask participants to arrive at 3 p.m. while telling local media it would begin at 4 p.m. <U+2015> to make it more likely they'd have a bigger crowd on hand by the time the cameras showed up.'Donald Trump has done an outstanding job,' he told HuffPost later. 'He's going to go down as one of the best presidents.'Yet most of the night's discussion was not about impeachment but about local issues. The five dozen or so activists listened to updates from city, county and state elected officials about new sheds for snowplows and whether they were situated too remotely for crews to get to them safely in storms. They heard updates about the continued flooding from the Missouri River. And they asked about the possibility of extending local tax relief to farmers, who have been hurt not only by the flooding but also by the president's trade war.Mary Ann Hanusa, a local Iowa state representative who attended the meeting, said that farmers in the western part of the state understand the sacrifices that Trump has asked of them and that they continue to back him. 'They are willing to wait out the situation at this point,' she said.State GOP Chairman Jeff Kaufmann agreed. So long as a solution arrives in the next several months, he said, farmers and others in rural areas will continue supporting Trump. 'They're sticking with him,' he told HuffPost after the Lincoln-Reagan dinner.For Trump to win Iowa next year, he will need them to stick with him. Indeed, ever since he took office, that has been part of his campaign's reelection strategy: to replicate his 2016 path to victory, which lost the national popular vote by nearly 3 million but managed to squeak out wins in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin by a combined margin of just 77,744 votes.But a manufacturing recession, caused in large part by Trump's trade war, may be swinging Pennsylvania and Michigan away from him. Losing both of those states with every other state going the same way it did in 2016 would leave Trump with 270 electoral votes, the exact number needed to win a second term. That means his Democratic opponent could win by taking those two states plus either, say, Wisconsin or Iowa.And that is where the trade war's damage to agriculture could play a major role, with farmers in both Wisconsin and Iowa suffering because of retaliatory tariffs imposed by China on soybeans, corn, pork and other commodities.Troy Price, chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, said Trump won the state in 2016 by promising to increase markets and profits for Iowa farms. 'We have seen nothing but the opposite since he's been in office,' Price said. 'We've lost the markets that Iowans took decades to develop.'He said the loss of farm income has led to problems for others that rely on the farmers' success, such as the 160 workers who were laid off at a John Deere factory'in eastern Iowa. 'This is having ripple effects across the state,' Price said. 'I think the president has a big problem and Republicans have a big problem. ... Donald Trump presented himself as the change candidate. Unfortunately, the changes that he brought have not been good for Iowa.'David Kochel, a longtime Iowa Republican consultant, has a more sanguine view of Trump's chances, particularly if Democrats nominate one of their more progressive contenders. 'If Warren is the candidate, I think she struggles in a place like Iowa,' he said.What's more, he believes Republicans in the rural areas will stick with Trump, despite their personal misfortunes, because of the increasingly partisan divide between Iowa cities and the rest of the state.'The trend in rural counties is that they're continuing to go even further red,' Kochel said, adding that Trump's lower approval ratings do not necessarily mean he will lose. 'Trump can win when he's upside down. He proved it in 2016 and he can do it again in 2020.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here's how.",2019-11-12 19:45:24

"87",1444059189,"Trump To Welcome Turkey’s Erdogan To White House Amid Stressed Relations","WASHINGTON (AP) ' Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Donald Trump will meet as relations between the two NATO allies are at their lowest point in decades, with Turkey rebuffing the U.S. and turning toward Russia on security issues and Ankara facing a Washington backlash over attacks on Kurdish civilians during'its incursion into Syria'last month.Erdogan and Trump have a difficult agenda Wednesday that includes Turkey's decision to buy a Russian air defense system and its attack on U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in northern Syria. Their scheduled afternoon news conference, however, will give Trump a stage to counter'the first public hearings'in the House impeachment inquiry.Trump says Turkey has been a critical U.S. ally for decades, cites the strong economic upside to the relationship and maintains that the two countries have enough in common to overcome their differences. Some in Congress say Erdogan should never have been invited to the White House in the first place.Last month, the House overwhelmingly passed a bill to sanction senior Turkish officials and its army for the military incursion into Syria to fight the Kurds. Erdogan sees Kurdish forces in Syria as an extension of a separatist Kurdish group that's been fighting inside Turkey since the 1980s.In the Senate, two Democrats introduced legislation denouncing Turkey's targeting of journalists, political opponents, dissidents, minorities and others. They said the Turkish government had imprisoned more than 80,000 Turkish citizens, closed more than 1,500 non-governmental organizations on terrorism-related grounds and dismissed or suspended more than 130,000 civil servants from their jobs.'This is not the time or place to be extending hospitality and exchanging niceties with a dictator,' said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who sits on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees.In October, Trump'moved U.S. troops in Syria out of the way'of invading Turkish troops, a decision that critics said amounted to abandoning America's Kurdish allies to be attacked.'It has upended what was an oasis of stability, damaged U.S. credibility and standing on the world stage and strengthened the hands of Russia, Iran' and the Syrian government of Bashar Assad, Shaheen said.Trump administration officials have said the president told Turkey not to invade Syria. But when Erdogan insisted, they say Trump decided to move 28 Green Berets operating on the Turkey-Syria border so they wouldn't be caught in a crossfire between Turkish-backed forces and the Kurds.A State Department official said Trump is not rewarding Erdogan with a White House visit but is conducting diplomacy. The official said high-level consultations are needed because of the volatile situation in Syria that has displaced tens of thousands of people.Amnesty International recently released a report documenting killings, human rights violations and possible war crimes caused by Turkey-backed forces in northern Syria.'There has been a callous disregard for civilian lives, including attacks on residential areas,' said Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA. 'Over 100,000 people have fled this offensive and there are fears that the displaced are not getting access to food, to clear water, or to medical supplies.'She said Trump must send a message to Erdogan that these actions and unlawful behavior must stop and that those responsible be held accountable.A senior State Department official said that the U.S. is following up on reports of human rights violations and indiscriminate killings. The official was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly and spoke only on condition of anonymity.'The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has urged Turkey to investigate reported cases of summary executions committed by a Turkish-backed armed group in northern Syria. The U.N. cited video footage showing fighters with the Ahrar al-Sharqiya armed group filming themselves capturing and executing three Kurdish captives on a highway in northern Syria.The State Department has looked into these killings and has asked Turkey to investigate. The Turks have told the U.S. that the Syrians have set up a commission, the official said, but it's unclear what, if any, action the panel will take.Turkey reached truce agreements with Russia and the United States last month that halted the incursion and forced Kurdish fighters to retreat from Turkey's southern border. But Erdogan claims the Kurds have not vacated border areas and says he will give Trump a list of attacks carried out by Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish-led force.On the U.S. side, Trump will be expressing continued concern about Erdogan's purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense system. The U.S. and fellow NATO nations say the S-400 would aid Russian intelligence and compromise a U.S.-led fighter jet program.The U.S. has since kicked Erdogan out of a multinational program producing components of America's high-tech F-35 fighter jet. In response, Erdogan attended an annual Russian air show this summer in Moscow and expressed interest in buying the latest Russian Su-35 fighter jets.Trump has not yet decided whether to impose congressional sanctions on Turkey for the S-400 purchase.During his visit, Erdogan will be trying to get Turkey back in the F-35 program and also try to end an ongoing prosecution against a major Turkish bank, said Max Hoffman at Center for American Progress. Halkbank is accused of carrying out a scheme to evade sanctions against Iran by moving billions of dollars of Iranian oil revenue illegally.Birol Baskan, a scholar at the Middle East Institute, says Turkey needs the U.S. on its side to balance Russia and Iran's interests in Syria. 'The problem is, the U.S. seems not to be interested in doing that,' Baskan said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here's how.",2019-11-13 07:38:51

He said Sondland told Trump the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.'Following the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine,' Taylor testified. 'Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which [Trump's personal attorney Rudy] Giuliani was pressing for.'Taylor suggested the House Intelligence Committee is following up on his staff member's revelation. The aide is David Holmes,'counselor for political affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, according to'NBC News and CBS News. The Intelligence Committee on Wednesday announced that he is scheduled to testify behind closed doors on Friday.This, from William Taylor's prepared remarks, is new: pic.twitter.com/ZM4P2vknV6White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham shrugged off Taylor's new information about Trump's alleged call with Sondland, calling it 'hearsay.''The latest 'evidence' is an anonymous staffer who told someone he overheard someone else talking to POTUS on the phone,' Grisham said in a statement to CNBC. 'All the 'evidence' in this case is hearsay.'At a news conference later on Wednesday, Trump said he didn't recall speaking with Sondland after his call with Ukraine's president.'I know nothing about that,' Trump said. 'First time I've heard it. ... I don't recall. Not at all. Not even a little bit.'Taylor's revelation about Trump's call with Sondland came during the first day of public hearings in the House's impeachment inquiry into Trump.Trump's dealings with Ukraine, specifically his efforts to get Zelensky to commit to investigating Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden, were the subject of a whistleblower complaint filed in August and are now the centerpiece of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Sondland, who had no foreign policy experience prior to becoming ambassador, initially testified on Oct. 17 during a closed-door session before House investigators that he couldn't recall having any discussions about Biden or taking part in any campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate him.But Sondland significantly altered his story on Nov. 5 after Taylor and Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman contradicted his claims in their depositions. In his amended testimony, Sondland acknowledged that he was involved in Trump's attempted quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government.He is slated to publicly testify in the impeachment inquiry on Nov. 20.This story has been updated with Trump comments.

During that call, the staff member said he could hear Trump ask about 'the investigations,' an apparent reference to Trump's desire for the Ukrainians to announced probes into Biden and his son. Sondland also told Trump the Ukrainians were ready to move forward, according to Taylor's testimony.'Following the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,' Taylor testified.Taylor's testimony kicked off the public portion of the House impeachment inquiry, which will eventually move to the House Judiciary Committee and the full House. If the House votes to impeach Trump, the Republican-controlled Senate will decide whether to force Trump from office.George Kent, a top State Department official who testified alongside Taylor, said it became clear to him in mid-August that 'Giuliani's efforts to gin up politically motivated investigations were now infecting U.S. engagement with Ukraine.''Kent says Giuliani's 'smear campaign' against the former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, was 'ubiquitous' on Fox News and online.'Yovanovitch is set to testify on Friday.Kent said he did not believe that the U.S. 'should engage in selective, politically associated investigations or prosecutions against opponents of those in power, because such selective actions undermine the rule of law regardless of the country.'Taylor echoed his prior testimony in an Oct. 22 closed-door session and spoke about how the official foreign policy of the United States 'was undercut by the irregular efforts led by Mr. Giuliani.' He told lawmakers that he thought it was 'crazy' that the Trump administration was considering holding up assistance to Ukraine for political purposes.Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, accused Democrats of putting witnesses through a 'closed-door audition process' to see which witnesses were ready for television. Republicans planned to argue that Democrats have been determined to impeach Trump since the moment he took office.'Kent and Taylor were questioned for 45 minutes by Democratic staffer Daniel Goldman and for 45 minutes by Republican staffer Stephen Castor. Lawmakers on the committee questioned both officials in the afternoon.Republicans complained at the hearing that neither Kent nor Taylor had any firsthand knowledge of the president's actions and described their testimony as hearsay.'Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), one of Trump's top defenders on Capitol Hill, told reporters after the hearing that, although he thought both men were 'credible public servants,' their testimony was 'not credible because it's not based on firsthand knowledge.'The White House, of course, has blocked many primary witnesses from testifying at the same time they've complained there aren't any firsthand witnesses. When HuffPost asked if Meadows would tell Trump that the White House should cooperate with the investigation so individuals with firsthand knowledge could testify, Meadows demurred.'I don't know that the president's going to pay attention to what this member from North Carolina may or may not say,' Meadows replied with a smile.'The hearing kicked off a busy period for the impeachment process. Another hearing on Friday will include Yovanovitch. Jennifer William, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, will appear on Tuesday morning along with Lt. Col.

Murphy's potential removal from office comes as the first public impeachment hearings for President Donald Trump begin in Washington.Murphy set up the paid event through Caroline Wren, who serves as a national financial consultant for Trump Victory, according to email correspondence cited in the UF impeachment resolution. In addition to being the president's 2020 reelection committee, Trump Victory benefits the Republican National Committee and the Committee to Defend the President.Murphy and Wren discussed a potential speaking engagement featuring Trump Jr., Guilfoyle and RNC co-Chairman Tommy Hicks after meeting at Wren's house for a Fourth of July event, according to emails obtained by UF's newspaper, The Independent Florida Alligator. The publication'identified Murphy's father as a Washington lobbyist and Trump campaign donor.Money for the event came from UF's ACCENT Speakers Bureau, which is part of the student government, according to a copy of the engagement agreement.Because a'Student Body statute prohibits activity and service fee funds being spent in support of or against a political party 'at any level,' Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle were barred from campaigning for Trump at UF. During their appearance, however, they praised the president's policies and ideology and encouraged the audience to turn away from the 'socialist' Democratic Party, according to the Tampa Bay Times.'By using student fees to advance his own expressed political beliefs at the expense of the ' Student Government writ large, Mr. Murphy not only endangered students marginalized by the speakers' white nationalist supporters, but also abused his power to advance a particular political party at the expense of the students he should represent,' the impeachment resolution states.Attorney Daniel Nordby, who said he is representing Murphy amid the impeachment resolution, denied that his client violated any federal election law, state law or university policy, adding that the current situation is an example of American college students being''intolerant of conservative views.''The purpose of the event was to discuss and promote Donald Trump Jr.'s new number one New York Times best-selling book, and no campaign activity occurred at the event,' Nordby said in a statement sent to HuffPost on Thursday. 'Michael fights on campus to ensure all students' viewpoints are reflected in campus programming, and will continue to fight for those students until the end of his term as Student Body President.'In an earlier interview with the Alligator, Murphy said he asked Wren about bringing Trump Jr. to the campus for a noncampaign event. He said he made a similar request to Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign and that he and his staff declined when Sanders' representative asked if the candidate could host a campaign speech on the Gainesville campus.Wren told The Washington Post'in a statement that she reached out to Murphy in a 'personal capacity' and forgot to remove her Trump Victory signature from her email.At a UF student government meeting last week, students expressed conflicting views over the paid appearance that accommodated roughly 800 students.''There is no reason that any student body president anywhere should be doing political favors for the national financial consultant of a president's 2020 reelection committee,' one student said, according to local news station WCJB. 'Students, when it comes to how their student fee money is spent, should have answers. Last time I checked, I didn't agree to donate to Donald Trump's political campaign.'Others defending the event on the grounds of protected speech.'Regardless of how unpopular this speaker is, ACCENT's recent financing of this event was totally in-line with their mission statement of fostering intellectual diversity on campus by bringing sometimes controversial speakers,' another student told WCJB.'Hundreds of people protested outside the event featuring Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle.'Some expressed outrage that students were not consulted about the event before it was scheduled, the Tampa Bay Times reported.'It sends the message that student government doesn't care about the student body and what they want,' graduate student Maxine Donnelly told the newspaper.This story has been updated with a statement from Murphy's attorney,'Daniel Nordby.",2019-11-13 13:37:41

"94",1444414663,"Senate Unlikely To Cut Short Trump’s Impeachment Trial","The case against President Donald Trump will likely receive a substantive hearing in the Senate if the House votes to impeach him, according to Republicans in the upper chamber.Some of Trump's top allies have called for immediate dismissal of a potential trial in the Senate, insisting the president did nothing wrong when he demanded a foreign government open an investigation into his political opponent. Trump and his backers pan the House inquiry as a partisan witch hunt.But top Senate Republicans aren't prepared to short-circuit a possible trial, at least not before the evidence against Trump had been presented.'My own view is we should give people the opportunity to put the case on,' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters on Wednesday. He added that the length of a trial is 'impossible to predict.'Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said Wednesday he believed that a quick motion to dismiss any articles of impeachment sent to the Senate would fall short of the votes necessary to pass the chamber, which the GOP controls 53-47.Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), when asked about the likelihood of efforts to dismiss the case, said, 'I think the consensus in our conference is that we need to proceed and take seriously the responsibility we have under the Constitution.'During President Bill Clinton's 1999 month-long impeachment trial, Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) offered a motion to dismiss the case two weeks into the proceedings, but the effort was voted down.McConnell earlier this month didn't hesitate to predict that Trump would be acquitted if the Senate held a trial today, and most of his GOP colleagues have agreed with him. Less certainty surrounds the likely length of a trial.Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) recently predicted the whole process could take up to two months, but other senators have expressed doubt it would last that long, especially with the 2020 presidential caucuses and primaries set to begin in February.Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) argued that a lengthy trial would aid former Vice President Joe Biden in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.''That's going to screw every Democratic senator running for president,' he said.The length of a trial would depend in part on the ability of senators to reach bipartisan agreement on rules governing the proceedings. The Senate during the Clinton trial unanimously passed a resolution that established the procedure for filing motions and the questioning of witnesses. It's anyone's guess whether this Senate, sharply divided along party lines, could do the same.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said discussions over such matters haven't begun, due to ongoing budget talks.'Hopefully, Schumer and McConnell can get together to agree to some sort of order that can give us some clarity on the schedule and the length of the trial,' Cornyn said Wednesday.Schumer on Wednesday urged all Senate members to keep an open mind as the House impeachment began its public phase, with'new revelations already surfacing.'We heard some new facts today, that's all the more reason senators should keep their ears and minds open,' Schumer said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"97",1444474780,"7 Key Takeaways From The First Public Impeachment Hearing","The House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday'held the first televised hearing'of its impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Democrats are investigating his attempt to withhold U.S. military aid to Ukraine until the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination.Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary for Europe and Eurasian affairs, were the first two witnesses to publicly testify in the investigation, after they separately testified privately last month.Throughout the hearing, Democrats tried to get the witnesses to admit that Trump's behavior constituted an impeachable offense, while Republicans attempted to discredit the diplomats. Here are seven takeaways from Wednesday's hearing with Taylor and Kent.'Taylor revealed new information about Trump's dealings with Ukraine at Wednesday's hearing that he had not known about at the time of his private testimony. The ambassador said that last week, an aide told him about a conversation he had with Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who has become one of the most relevant characters in the investigation.Taylor said that his aide was at a restaurant with Sondland on July 26 ''the day after Trump's call with Zelensky that prompted the whistleblower to file a complaint ''when Sondland called Trump, who the aide apparently overheard ask the EU ambassador about 'the investigations.' Sondland reportedly told Trump the Ukrainians were ready to move forward, according to Taylor.'Following the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine,' Taylor said in his opening remarks. 'Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden which [Rudy] Giuliani was pressing for.'The Intelligence Committee said Wednesday that it has scheduled one of Taylor's aides to privately testify on Friday. According to NBC News, that person's name is David Holmes and is the same staff member who overheard Sondland's call with Trump.'Taylor said that there are 'two Ukraine stories' going on: one regarding Trump's impeachment and the whistleblower's complaint, in which the ambassador said the country is 'merely an object'; and a 'positive, bipartisan' one where Ukraine is the subject.The ambassador discussed Ukraine's struggle to maintain independence from Russia, and looks to Western countries like the United States for guidance about government and democracy. Ukraine has been receiving security assistance from the U.S. in order to protect itself from Russia, which is why Trump's freezing of the assistance astonished Taylor.'To withhold that assistance for no good reason other than help with a political campaign made no sense,' Taylor said. 'It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.'Kent also explained the importance of Ukraine to American foreign policy, saying that the country's success 'is very much in our national interest.'When Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) asked Taylor how security assistance for Ukraine affects U.S. national security, the ambassador stressed that the U.S. considers Russia and China as adversaries but identifies Ukraine as a strategic partner.'The Russians are violating all of the rules, treaties, understandings, that they committed to that actually kept the peace in Europe for nearly 70 years. That rule of law ... was violated by the Russians and if we don't push back on that, on those violations, then that will continue,' Taylor said. 'And that, Mr. Chairman, affects us. It affects the world that we live in, that our children will grow up in, and our grandchildren.'Taylor said at the hearing that Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, 'undercut' U.S. foreign policy by creating an unofficial backchannel to Ukrainian officials. He also said he thought it was 'crazy' that the White House considered freezing military aid to Ukraine for political reasons.Kent built upon Taylor's concern, saying in his opening statement that it was 'unexpected, and most unfortunate, to watch some Americans <U+2015> including those who allied themselves with corrupt Ukrainians in pursuit of private agendas <U+2015> launch attacks on dedicated public servants.' The diplomat was referencing Giuliani's disparagement of Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine whom Trump decided to recall in response to conspiracy theories spread by his personal attorney.Kent added that he realized in mid-August that 'Giuliani's efforts to gin up politically motivated investigations were now infecting U.S. engagement with Ukraine.'Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) asked Taylor and Kent whether Giuliani was promoting U.S. national interests or policy while meddling in Ukraine. Both witnesses said no.'I believe he was looking to dig up political dirt against a potential rival in the next election cycle,' Kent responded. Taylor agreed.Giuliani told CNN during the hearing that he didn't do anything wrong, a defense he's consistently used throughout this investigation.''GOP lawyer Steve Castor made his debut appearance on Wednesday, and many of his leading questions fell short as Taylor and Kent stuck with what they knew.'Castor pointed out Taylor's earlier remarks that Giuliani's backchannel to Ukrainian officials was an 'irregular' way to conduct diplomacy.'I want to turn to the discussion of the irregular channel you described,' Castor said. 'In fairness, this irregular channel of diplomacy, it's not as outlandish as it could be, is that correct?'Taylor laughed at the bizarre question before saying that it could, indeed, always be worse.'It's not as outlandish as it could be, I agree,' the ambassador said.The GOP counsel then said Sondland's involvement in Ukrainian dealings was 'certainly not outlandish' despite it not being part of the European Union ambassador's official duties.'It's a little unusual for the U.S. ambassador to the EU to play a role in Ukraine policy,' Taylor retorted.'OK, it might be irregular, but it's certainly not outlandish,' Castor said, prompting Taylor to look baffled.The exchange'drew reactions on Twitter from observers'who teased Castor for his line'of defense for Republicans.'Despite spending weeks developing strategies to delegitimize the first public impeachment hearing, Republicans on Wednesday had messy, slipshod questions'for the two nonpartisan witnesses.Part of Republicans' arguments were based on the unsubstantiated conspiracy theories found in far-right media that initially fueled Trump's suspicions of Ukraine and his push to investigate the Bidens. Several GOP members also tried to make the argument that Trump did not commit a crime because his attempt at a quid pro quo was exactly that <U+2015> an attempt.'The GOP's counsel introduced confusion with his bizarre questions, including the 'outlandish' ones, plus a query directed at Taylor about whether Trump should be upset by reports of Ukrainian officials opposing his presidential candidacy. Taylor responded that the president mentioned during his 2016 campaign that he might let Russia keep Crimea, and that that 'sentiment is amazingly inflammatory to all Ukrainians.'While the questions may make good television clips for Trump and his base, they often left Kent and Taylor looking baffled and confused about how to respond to right-wing conspiracy theories.'Throughout the hearing <U+2015> especially during the lightning round where lawmakers were given five minutes to question the witnesses <U+2015> Republicans remarked that Taylor and Kent's testimony cannot be taken seriously because they are not direct witnesses of any wrongdoing by Trump.The White House's own Twitter account posted during the hearing: 'Don't rely on second, third, and fourth-hand accounts.''But in reality, White House orders blocking direct witnesses from testifying is the reason that Democrats have been unable to speak with more people who have firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing.Some of the witnesses Democrats have subpoenaed to appear before the investigating committees are White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and former national security adviser John Bolton. All refused to testify because of a White House order directing employees of the administration to not comply with the impeachment investigation.Bolton's former deputy, Charles Kupperman, filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to determine whether a House subpoena has more power than the White House directive. The House withdrew its subpoena for Kupperman while asking the judge to dismiss his lawsuit in order to avoid delaying impeachment hearings, though it's unclear whether Kupperman has withdrawn his lawsuit in response.'GOP members repeatedly brought up the fact that the whistleblower who filed the bombshell complaint that spurred the impeachment investigation remains anonymous. Those same members also criticized Schiff for not bringing the whistleblower in to testify. (Schiff has said that there's no need to risk the anonymous intelligence official's safety when other witnesses have corroborated the complaint's allegations.)Several Republicans, including Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), accused Schiff of previously speaking to the whistleblower and refusing to release details of such alleged discussions with the rest of the Intelligence Committee. The chairman stressed throughout the hearing that he has not communicated with the whistleblower, and that accusations otherwise are false.'We'll never get a chance to question' the person that 'started it all,' Jordan said, referencing the whistleblower.'I'd be glad to have the person who 'started it all' come in and testify,' Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) said in response. 'President Trump is welcome to take a seat right there.'Trump has repeatedly called for revealing the whistleblower's identity, and accused anyone who talked to the official of treason. He's also pushed the media to unmask the whistleblower. Such remarks have led Democrats and the whistleblower's lawyers to be increasingly concerned for the person's safety.The attorneys sent a cease-and-desist letter earlier this month to the White House's legal counsel, urging the president to stop the dangerous rhetoric that could put the whistleblower's life at risk. They also said their client would be willing to answer Republicans' questions in writing, though the committee's ranking member, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), rejected the invitation.After Wednesday's impeachment hearing, Republicans tried to pass a motion to subpoena the whistleblower to come testify. The motion was tabled, meaning it did not pass.This article has been updated to note additional details about the House's subpoena of Kupperman and his lawsuit.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"98",1444487945,"White House Throws Its Everyday, Unfocused, Tweet-Based Response At Impeachment","WASHINGTON <U+2015> The White House reacted to the first day of public impeachment hearings with unfocused statements, personal attacks and occasional exclamation-pointed Twitter statements by President Donald Trump himself <U+2015> in other words, as if it were any normal Wednesday.The White House press staff announced midmorning that Trump was 'not watching, but working,' only to see the president's Twitter account repeatedly post about the testimony. Press secretary Stephanie Grisham declared the hearing to be 'boring,' not long before Trump in a photo opportunity said the hearing that he supposedly was not watching featured 'television lawyers.'Trump's Republican allies on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, brought up various elements of a conspiracy theory about Ukraine in their questions to the two witnesses testifying before the House Intelligence Committee.'Democrats are talking facts, what Trump did, what Trump said,' former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, who is running against Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination, told HuffPost. 'Republicans are responding with 'Deep state! Hillary! The dossier! Witch hunt!''After the testimony in the House wrapped up for the day, Trump claimed not to even remember the one key new piece of information revealed Wednesday in his alleged extortion scheme: a July 26 phone call with his political donor-turned-ambassador Gordon Sondland.Career diplomat William Taylor, currently the interim ambassador to Ukraine, testified in the House that one of his staff members there overheard that call in which Trump specifically asked Sondland 'about the investigation' and that Sondland then told Taylor's staffer that 'President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden' than about Ukraine.At a news conference later Wednesday afternoon, Trump said he had no memory of that conversation. 'I know nothing about that. First time I've heard it,' he said. 'I don't recall. No, not at all. Not even a little bit.'It was unclear what role, if any, two White House staffers recently hired specifically to handle impeachment investigation response played on Wednesday. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and former Treasury spokesman Tony Sayegh were announced with some fanfare last week as those who would provide 'proactive impeachment messaging,' but neither appeared to make an appreciable difference in the Trump White House's functioning on Wednesday.One senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Trump's West Wing is, in fact, setting up a rapid-response team, sharing talking points with outside surrogates, arranging media interviews and working to place friendly op-eds. 'We're doing what White House communications teams do,' the official said, but acknowledged that Trump was not necessarily bound by their plan and would continue to put out his own message whenever he wanted to.Taylor and State Department official George Kent were the first of multiple witnesses expected to publicly lay out the details behind Trump's attempt to use congressionally approved military aid as leverage to coerce Ukraine into investigating both the Democrat he has feared most in 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden, and a conspiracy theory that tries to clear Russia of helping Trump win the 2016 election.That theory claims that Ukraine actually helped Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign while planting false evidence to make it appear that Russia had helped Trump. It also claims that billionaire George Soros, a favorite bogeyman of the conservative fringe, was behind the whole scheme.Tom Bossert, Trump's former homeland security adviser, recently called the conspiracy theory 'completely debunked.'The president and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani nevertheless appear to believe it. Trump referred to it in his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he also mentioned Biden by name.It was Trump's release of a rough transcript of that call <U+2015> he continues to describe the call as 'perfect' <U+2015> that helped swing dozens of Democratic members of Congress as well as millions of Americans generally from opposing impeachment to supporting it.Since that time, Trump and his GOP allies have criticized the anonymous whistleblower who brought the contents of that call to light. They've also gone after Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son, who served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company during the time his father was spearheading U.S. anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine.Apart from attacking Hunter Biden and the whistleblower, Republicans on Wednesday made two principal arguments in Trump's defense. The president ultimately released the aid without Ukraine having announced any of the demanded investigations, they claimed, and Ukraine did not even know about the hold on the $391 million until well after the July 25 phone call. Because of this, they said, Trump could not have coerced Ukraine.But the chronology of events shows that the military aid was only released on Sept. 11 <U+2015> two days after White House officials learned that a whistleblower from the intelligence community had filed a formal complaint about the effort, which would soon make its way to Congress. Further, Ukrainian officials learned of Trump's block on the aid by early August, and by the middle of that month Zelensky was reluctantly leaning toward announcing the investigations as demanded in a televised interview.Other Trump allies, meanwhile, pushed a separate argument: that Trump was completely within his rights to set U.S. policy regarding Ukraine as he wished.'This is a foreign policy debate between the permanent political class of both parties and 'America First,'' said Stephen Bannon, a former senior White House aide to Trump who is now producing a daily podcast to defend the president.Critics pointed out that this argument essentially means that presidents are permitted to fashion foreign policy largely to help their own reelections and to harm their political opponents.Democrats said that approach is illegal and clearly impeachable. 'One cannot, even as president, use the public trust of high office for personal gain,' Rep. Peter Welch of Vermont said during the hearing. 'The law prohibits any one of us here on the dais from seeking foreign assistance in our campaigns.''It seems to me that the president of the United States either committed extortion and bribery of a foreign official or attempted extortion and bribery of a foreign official,' said Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas.With the facts of the episode all arrayed against them, Trump's defenders seem to be relying on the concept of 'jury nullification,' Danya Perry, a former federal prosecutor in New York City, said to HuffPost. That's when juries who believe the defendant is guilty vote to acquit anyway because they don't think the punishment is warranted.'House Republicans seem to believe that their best hope lies in persuading the voting public and their representatives in the Senate to nullify in spite of the facts presented at the hearings,' Perry said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"99",1444509778,"House Republicans Did A Really Bad Job Defending Trump From Ukraine Allegations","House Republicans used the first public hearing of the impeachment inquiry to broadcast a series of confusing, contradictory and conspiratorial defenses of President Donald Trump.'The president's Republican allies have spent weeks strategizing ways to discredit the impeachment inquiry into Trump's effort to compel the Ukrainian government to investigate his political rivals in exchange for military assistance. But none of that planning was evident on Wednesday, when they questioned State Department officials Bill Taylor and George Kent.'Throughout the nearly six-hour hearing, Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee veered between defending the idea of investigating corruption in Ukraine, and Hunter Biden in particular, and simultaneously claiming it was outrageous to suggest the president would do so. They shouted easily refutable criticism of the witnesses' testimony and spoke of baseless conspiracy theories popularized in the deep reaches of conservative media. At times the witnesses ' both experts in U.S. policy on Ukraine ' appeared confused by the far-right line of questioning.'One possible explanation for the Republican members' tactics was that they were aimed at hardening the opinions of the true believers in the vast television viewing audience, including one particular viewer likely watching from the White House.''I think it'll be effective with the base,' Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) told HuffPost after the hearing. 'I just remind them that when they, you know, when they talk about the witnesses and debunked conspiracy theories, we're in the Capitol, not Area 51.'Alternately, House Republicans were perhaps testing various defenses in hopes that one would stick ' or at least that the confusion would muddy the case for impeachment.'Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking member of the committee, used his opening statement to claim that the 'Democrats cooperated in Ukrainian election meddling' in 2016 to hurt Trump's chances of winning. Nunes' claim is based on a 2017 Politico article that described how a Ukrainian-American political operative helped the Democratic National Committee get information about then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's shady past work in Ukraine.'Contrary to Nunes' claims, there is no evidence of broad collusion between the Ukrainian government and the Democratic Party. Nonetheless, the notion of Democratic-Ukrainian collusion has morphed into an elaborate conspiracy theory in which Ukraine somehow framed Russia for hacking the DNC and the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike helped cover it up. This baseless theory has been used by Republican operatives to justify Trump's desire to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter and Ukraine's supposed role in the 2016 election.But hours later, Nunes contradicted himself. When it was his turn to question the witnesses, he claimed it made no sense to suggest that Trump would want Ukraine to launch an investigation. 'I think one of the mothers of all conspiracy theories is that somehow the president of the United States would want a country that he doesn't even like, he doesn't want to give foreign aid to, to have the Ukrainians start an investigation into the Bidens,' Nunes said.The Republicans face a difficult task in undermining the impeachment inquiry. The anonymous whistleblower complaint that prompted the inquiry has been largely proved accurate by the White House's transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky and text messages between U.S. officials. Trump's acting chief of staff,'Mick Mulvaney, has confirmed the quid pro quo request. And on Wednesday, longtime State Department officials provided detailed testimony of how they learned about Trump and his allies' effort to withhold military aid to Ukraine until the country publicly announced the launch of the investigations requested by the president.'In response to Taylor's detailed description of how a ragtag team of Trump allies co-opted the State Department's Ukraine policy to personally benefit the president, GOP counsel Steve Castor countered, 'It's not as outlandish as it could be, correct?'Several House Republicans tried to cast Taylor and Kent as unreliable witnesses because they had not spoken directly to Trump about his dealings with Ukraine. Democrats pointed out that the White House was blocking several government officials ' including Mulvaney, former national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ' from testifying.'Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) argued that Trump's Ukraine arrangement couldn't be a quid pro quo because Zelensky did not yet know the Trump administration had placed a hold on military aid when Trump asked him in a July 25 phone call to investigate the Bidens. But Zelensky did find out about the security assistance delay the'next month. U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, a Trump campaign donor, made clear to Zelensky that he needed to 'clear things up' to avoid a 'stalemate,' Taylor testified. Zelensky understood the terms of the deal and made plans to give a statement on CNN.'Ratcliffe also tried to point to Zelenksy's claim in an October news conference that he did not feel pressured to follow Trump's demands in exchange for weapons. But victims of extortion often have compelling reasons to deny they are being extorted, as former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara pointed out. In Zelensky's case, he was still reliant on Trump for military equipment to defend his country against Russia ' and the revelation that he was willing to do Trump's bidding would have destroyed his reputation at home as an anti-corruption reformer.'By the end of the hearing, some Republicans appeared exhausted trying to come up with defenses for the president. All that matters, according to Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), is that, 'Number one: Ukraine received the aid. Number two: there was, in fact, no investigation into Biden.''In other words, it doesn't matter because Trump got caught before he could pull it off.''Arthur Delaney contributed reporting.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

What's ahead on the impeachment schedule:'More WitnessesThe House intelligence committee, which is conducting the impeachment hearings, has set a packed schedule of open hearings over the next week.On Friday, lawmakers will hear from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine'Marie Yovanovitch,'who was ousted in May at Trump's direction. She'told lawmakers'in a closed-door deposition last month that there was a 'concerted campaign' against her as Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani pushed for probes of Democrat Joe Biden and other political opponents.Eight more witnesses will testify next week, some in back-to-back hearings on the same day. Among them will be Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official who said he raised concerns in the White House about Trump's push for investigations; Gordon Sondland, Trump's European Union ambassador, who spoke to the president about the Ukraine policy; and Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser to the White House who told lawmakers about national security adviser John Bolton's concerns about Ukraine.All witnesses testifying this week and next have already spoken to investigators in closed depositions, some of them for 10 hours or more.'Back Behind Closed DoorsThough those private depositions are largely done, Democrats have scheduled two more for this week ' at the same time they are conducting the open hearings.Democrats have scheduled a closed-door session with David Holmes, the political counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, for Friday. An official familiar with the matter said Holmes is the person Taylor referred to in his testimony on Wednesday when he said an aide had overheard a conversation between Sondland and Trump in July about Ukraine conducting investigations.They have also scheduled a Saturday deposition with Mark Sandy, an official at the Office of Management and Budget. Sandy is one of several OMB officials who have been invited by the committee to appear as lawmakers try to find out more about the military aid that was withheld. So far, none of those officials has shown up for their depositions as Trump has instructed his administration not to cooperate.While the open hearings are being conducted by the intelligence panel, the closed-door hearings have been held by the intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees.'Headed To JudiciaryThe public hearings are expected to last at least another week. After that, the three committees will submit a report to the Judiciary panel, which will oversee the impeachment process.Judiciary is expected to hold its own hearings and, eventually, vote on articles of impeachment. Democrats say they are still deciding whether to write them.Next would come a floor vote, and if articles of impeachment are approved by the House, there would then be a Senate trial.House Democrats are hoping to finish the process by the end of the year.

"111",1445142391,"2nd U.S. Official Heard Trump Call With Sondland","WASHINGTON (AP) ' A second U.S. Embassy staffer in Kyiv overheard a cellphone call between President Donald Trump and his ambassador to the European Union discussing a need for Ukrainian officials to pursue 'investigations,' The Associated Press has learned.The July 26 call between Trump and Gordon Sondland was first described during testimony Wednesday by William Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Taylor said one of his staffers overhead the call while Sondland was in a Kyiv restaurant the day after Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that triggered'the House impeachment inquiry.The second diplomatic staffer also at the table was Suriya Jayanti, a foreign service officer based in Kyiv. A person briefed on what Jayanti overheard spoke to AP on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter currently under investigation.The accounts of the two embassy staffers could tie Trump closer to alleged efforts to hold up military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigations into political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings. In defending Trump on Wednesday, Republicans repeatedly highlighted that Taylor never directly heard the president direct anyone to demand that the Ukrainians open the probe.Trump on Wednesday said he did not recall the July 26 call with Sondland.'No, not at all, not even a little bit,' Trump said.The White House did not respond to questions Thursday about the second witness to the call with Sondland.The staffer Taylor testified about is David Holmes, the political counselor at the embassy in Kyiv, according to an official familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity.Holmes is scheduled to testify Friday before House investigators in a closed session.Taylor was one of the first witnesses called Wednesday during the impeachment inquiry's initial open hearing. He testified that his staffer could hear Trump on the phone asking Sondland about 'the investigations.'Later that day, a Twitter account that appears to belong to Ukraine's then-Defense Minister Oleksandr Danylyuk'posted a photo'of himself at dinner with Sondland, Taylor and Ambassador Kurt Volker, who was then Trump's special envoy to Ukraine for peace negotiations.Since 2014, the Ukrainian government has been battling Russian-backed separatists in the country's eastern region, and the continuation of U.S. military aid is crucial to its defense. Whether Trump directed nearly $400 million in aid to be withheld to force the Ukrainians to open investigations into Democrats is a key question of the impeachment inquiry.Current and former U.S. officials say Sondland's use of a cellphone in a public place in Ukraine to speak with anyone in the U.S. government back home about sensitive matters, let alone the president, would be a significant breach of communications security.Jayanti is an attorney who joined the State Department in 2012 and was previously posted at the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. She has been stationed since September 2018 at the embassy in Kyiv where she helps coordinate U.S. business interests with the former Soviet republic's energy industry.Jayanti was in Washington last month and scheduled for a closed-door interview with impeachment investigators. But the deposition was canceled because of the funeral for former House Oversight Chair Elijah Cummings and has not yet been rescheduled.Holmes, a career diplomat, joined the Foreign Service in 2002 and has served in Afghanistan, Colombia, India, Kosovo and Russia as well as on the White House National Security Council staff. He won an award for constructive dissent from the American Foreign Service Association in 2014 for complaining about problems that an alternate diplomatic channel had caused in South Asia and recommending organizational changes to the State Department's bureaucratic structure for the region.U.S. diplomats and other government employees are instructed not to use cellphones for sensitive official matters while traveling anywhere abroad and notably in countries known to be targeted for surveillance by intelligence agencies such as Russia, China and Israel.Ukraine has long been among the countries of concern, particularly since a 2014 incident in which the U.S. accused Russian intelligence of eavesdropping on and then leaking a recording of a conversation between two senior U.S. officials in Kyiv that led to great embarrassment and strains between the U.S. and its European allies.In that recording, then-Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland is heard telling former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoff Pyatt 'F-ck the EU,' because of the European Union's slowness to respond to the political crisis in the country.'That phone call was also a mistake the way it was conducted and it had huge implications for our foreign policy,' said Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia who is now at Stanford University. 'Particularly after that, anybody should understand how dangerous it is to make an unsecured call in Kyiv, or anywhere else for that matter.''Obviously, making a phone call from Kyiv to the president of the United States means that not just the Russian intelligence services will be on the call, but a whole lot of other people, too,' McFaul said. 'If it was that important, he (Sondland) could have easily gotten up from the restaurant, gone to the embassy and made a secure call through the White House operations center.'Steven Pifer, who served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 1998 to 2000, said he always assumed his cellphone calls were being monitored and would not discuss anything sensitive unless he was on a secure phone at the embassy or his residence.'Any unsecure call is vulnerable, but there's a special risk if it's the president's number on your phone,' Pifer said. 'You have to know everyone is going to be interested in it and not just the Russians.'In a closed-door hearing last month, former White House Russia adviser Fiona Hill said she was concerned that Sondland posed a counterintelligence risk, according to a transcript released by the House. Hill cited a Sondland habit of giving out personal cellphone numbers ' hers and national security adviser John Bolton's as well as his own ' and his failure to get appropriately briefed ahead of meetings.'So he was often meeting with people he had no information about,' said Hill, who served as the senior director for Russia at the National Security Council. 'It's like basically driving along with no guardrails and no GPS on an unfamiliar territory.'She said Sondland was meeting with foreign officials 'that we had derogatory information on that he shouldn't have been meeting with' or he was giving out his phone number or texting foreign officials. 'All of those communications could have been exfiltrated by the Russians very easily,' she said.Hill said officials from Europe would literally appear at the gates of the White House and call her personal phone, which was kept in a lockbox. She said she'd later find messages from irate officials who'd been told by Sondland that they were supposed to meet with her.She said she found it deeply concerning and asked for someone from the Intelligence Bureau to 'sit down with him and explain that this was a counterintelligence risk.'___Associated Press writers Lynn Berry and Jill Colvin contributed from Washington.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"112",1445243707,"Matt Bevin Concedes In Kentucky Governor’s Race","FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) ' Republican Gov. Matt Bevin conceded to Democratic archnemesis Andy Beshear on Thursday, putting an end to Kentucky's bitterly fought governor's race.Bevin, an ally of President Donald Trump, made the dramatic announcement outside his statehouse office on the same day election officials across Kentucky double-checked vote totals at his request.'We're going to have a change in the governorship based upon the vote of the people,' Bevin said at the news conference before wishing attorney general Beshear well in the new role.'I truly want the best for Andy Beshear as he moves forward. I genuinely want him to be successful, I genuinely want this state to be successful,' Bevin said.Last week's election results showed Bevin trailing Beshear by more than 5,000 votes out of more than 1.4 million cast, for a lead of less than 0.4 percentage points.In the days after the election, Bevin had steadfastly refused to concede while hinting, without offering evidence, that there had been 'irregularities' in the voting.Bevin, however, faced a growing chorus of state Republicans urging him to accept the results of the recanvass unless he could point to evidence of substantial voter fraud.Beshear, the son of a former two-term Kentucky governor, already declared victory and has been preparing to become governor in December.The Kentucky contest was watched closely for early signs of how the impeachment furor in Washington might affect Trump and other Republicans. Bevin railed against the inquiry and illegal immigration in trying to nationalize the race, while Beshear kept his focus on state issues such as education, health care and pensionsBevin could have contested the outcome once it was certified by the state Board of Elections, which is scheduled to meet Nov. 21. Contesting an election could have put the outcome in the hands of the GOP-led legislature. The last time Kentucky lawmakers decided a governor's race was the 1899 election, in a dispute marked by the assassination of the Democrat who was declared the winner.Beshear's upset win gives Democrats a victory in a state that had been trending heavily toward Republican in recent years.Beshear followed a disciplined campaign style focused on what he termed 'kitchen table' issues, such as health care and education, while capitalizing on Bevin's penchant for making enemies of teachers and other groups. The new governor-elect avoided talking about Trump, impeachment or other polarizing national issues that risked energizing his opponent's conservative base.Trump loomed large in the race as Bevin stressed his alliance with the Republican president in TV ads, tweets and speeches. Trump carried Kentucky by a landslide in winning the presidency in 2016 and remains popular in the state. The president took center stage in the campaign with his election-eve rally in Lexington to energize his supporters to head to the polls for his fellow Republican.But the combative Bevin was unable to overcome a series of self-inflicted wounds, highlighted by a running feud with teachers who opposed his efforts to revamp the state's woefully underfunded public pension systems. Beshear effectively exploited the feud, branding Bevin as a bully.Bevin lashed out at teachers who used sick days to rally at Kentucky's Capitol. In 2018, Bevin asserted without evidence that an unidentified child who had been left home alone somewhere in the state had been sexually assaulted on a day of mass school closings as teachers rallied. He apologized but doubled down earlier this year by connecting a girl's shooting in Louisville with school closings caused by teacher protests.The election outcome settles a bitter rivalry between Beshear and Bevin.As attorney general, Beshear sued Bevin to challenge several of his policy and executive decisions. Beshear challenged Bevin's actions to make wholesale changes to boards and commissions. In the highest-profile case, one of Beshear's lawsuits led Kentucky's Supreme Court to strike down a Bevin-supported pension law on procedural grounds last year.___Associated Press Writer Dylan Lovan contributed to this report from Louisville, Kentucky.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Every Republican present but one, Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), voted to confirm him.Click here to see how every senator voted. The final tally was 51-41.''Menashi, 40, is one of Trump's most controversial court picks to date. Nearly every national civil and women's rights group opposed him, including the NAACP, the National Organization for Women, the Human Rights Campaign, Muslim Advocates and Planned Parenthood. Democrats questioned his qualifications <U+2015> he has never tried a case, made oral arguments in court or conducted a deposition <U+2015> as well as his temperament.In past editorials, Menashi, who is currently Trump's White House legal aide, compared race data collection in college admissions to Germany under Adolf Hitler; denounced women's marches against sexual assault; opposed the 'radical abortion rights codified in Roe v. Wade'; accused the Human Rights Campaign of having 'incessantly exploited the slaying of Matthew Shepard' for political benefit, and claimed that a Dartmouth fraternity wasn't being racist when it held a 'ghetto party' attended by white students donning Afros and carrying toy guns.He also spread the Islamophobic myth that in 1913, Gen. John Pershing executed Muslim prisoners in the Philippines using bullets dipped in pig fat.During his confirmation hearing last month, Menashi angered both Republican and Democratic senators by refusing to give details about his White House legal work. He conceded that he worked on immigration policies with Trump's senior adviser Stephen Miller, the chief architect of Trump's ban on travelers from several Muslim-majority countries and Trump's policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.He also served as legal counsel to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos when she rolled back Title IX protections for survivors of sexual assault on campuses.Menashi ignored senators' follow-up questions about his potential role in White House efforts to cover up evidence of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the center of the House impeachment inquiry. Menashi has been Trump's legal adviser for more than a year, which covers the period in which Trump appears to have broken the law by pressuring Zelensky to interfere in the 2020 U.S. elections to help him win.Earlier this week, The New York Times reported that Menashi also helped devise an illegal Education Department effort to use private Social Security data to deny debt relief to thousands of students cheated by for-profit colleges.None of these details swayed Republicans to oppose Menashi.''Mr. Menashi won major support from the Judiciary Committee ... on the basis of strong academic and legal qualifications,' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said ahead of Thursday's vote. 'I would urge all of our colleagues to confirm this impressive nominee.'The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals is based in New York, where Menashi doesn't have support from either of the home-state senators ' something that rarely happens and is embarrassing. Both of them condemned him ahead of his confirmation vote.'Mr. Menashi is one of the most contemptible nominees to come before the Senate in all my time in this body,' said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). 'His record on race, women's equality, LGBTQ rights, and the rights of immigrants should be disqualifying.''I don't say this lightly: He's one of the worst judicial nominees to be put forth by President Trump<U+2015>and I intend to cast a resounding no vote,' Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) tweeted.Menashi will now fill a seat on the 2nd Court of Appeals that was previously held by former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, a champion of civil rights.'A disgrace,' Lena Zwarensteyn of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights said in a statement.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"115",1445286237,"Democrats Don’t Mind If The Hearings Are A Show","WASHINGTON <U+2015> If there's one thing Democrats and Republicans both agree on with the impeachment hearings, it's this: There's a certain inevitability to them.Democrats will bring forward many of the same witnesses they have already deposed for hours, to repeat testimony they already took, only to have Republicans focus only on the most exculpatory details while disregarding the mountains of incriminating evidence that President Donald Trump sought to influence U.S. elections with foreign help <U+2015> even dangling nearly $400 million in security aid to entice the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden and his son.And at the end of these hearings, after we've heard hours of testimony that is obviously damning, the House will hold a vote it already held, to a similar, near-party-line result.The inevitability doesn't mean the hearings aren't important. We may have a really strong idea of what will come out in these televised inquisitions, and that none of it will matter with Republicans, but Democrats see the hearings as a chance to educate the public.'There's a reason that, in a jury trial, you don't just hand the jurors transcripts, right?' Democrat Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) told HuffPost. 'You get to see the person. So much of our language is communicated nonverbally.'Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) said the more voters see these public hearings, the better it would be for Democrats to make the case to impeach Trump.'There's value in actually having these folks tell the story to the American people,' Huffman said. 'There's value in having the country tune in and see these preposterous Republican claims contrasted by these unimpeachable witnesses who are just doing their patriotic duty and telling the truth.'And Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said the hearings would be an opportunity for normal people to contrast serious-minded witnesses with 'the conspiracy theories that the Trump defenders are offering.'He added that voters would see 'career professionals, who obviously know what they're talking about, who are not political, who are not arm-waving 'Never Trumpers,' but just speaking the truth.'While Republicans certainly don't see these hearings moving the needle on public opinion the same way Democrats anticipate, they were happy to charge that the hearings were more about putting on a show than finding new facts.Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas), who sits on the Intelligence Committee and was also once Trump's pick to be director of national intelligence before Ratcliffe withdrew from consideration, said he didn't mind telling HuffPost that 'the House Democrats already made up their mind.''I think they had before all this started that they plan to impeach this president,' Ratcliffe continued.When we countered that Republicans also seemed to have made up their minds that they wouldn't impeach Trump, Ratcliffe agreed.'Yeah, I think so, because we've seen all the evidence,' he said.And when you confront Republicans like Ratcliffe with the evidence, that Trump clearly pressured a foreign government to open an investigation into a political opponent, they will argue there is nothing wrong with that.'He is the unitary executive, so he is vested with that authority to open or close investigations where there is a prima facie case of anything,' Ratcliffe said. 'And so, if he believes there's a prima facie case of corruption, he has the ability to pursue that.'(Ratcliffe kept using the Latin term 'prima facie,' a legal term that literally translates to 'at first face.')For the record, as the Federal Election Commission chairwoman recently reminded all candidates, it is illegal to solicit campaign help from foreign governments. And Trump conditioning security aid appropriated by Congress on Ukraine opening an investigation into Biden actually borders on extortion, former federal prosecutors note.Republicans were also happy to charge that, if the hearings were a show, it was a bad one for Democrats.'I saw a lot of the reporters yawning and looking at the ceiling,' Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who watched the hearing from the audience section, said Wednesday.'Talk about laying an egg,' Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) said of Democrats.And fellow Arizona Republican Paul Gosar told HuffPost that Democrats hadn't 'moved anybody' on the Republican side. 'And with that kind of testimony, that was hardly compelling for the other side,' he said.The word 'boring' got tossed around a lot on conservative Twitter feeds, with Eric Trump tweeting that it was a #SnoozeFest. That prompted 'Daily Show' host Trevor Noah to facetiously quote-tweet Trump with, 'Good point. Article 6, Section 2 of the Constitution clearly states that a President can't be impeached for crimes that don't excite his third-favorite child.'Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) recounted that Noah tweet to reporters Wednesday night when he was asked about the right-wing charges that the hearing was 'boring.''Yeah, I'm sorry if, you know, we didn't entertain them, but that wasn't the goal for today,' Swalwell said.Still, for a hearing that was largely for the edification of the American people rather than to discover new facts, the entertainment value of these hearings isn't an entirely unfair measure.In a normal world, it would be stunning news that an ambassador was told that 'everything' <U+2015> meaning a White House meeting with the Ukrainian president, as well as the $400 million in military aid <U+2015> was contingent on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announcing an investigation into the energy company that once employed Hunter Biden.More to the point, the hearing actually did include a new bombshell not included in the released transcripts. William Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said an aide had recently told him he overheard Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, on the phone with Trump. The president was heard asking about 'the investigations,' Taylor said.The implication is that Trump was even more actively involved in the quid pro quo than previously known <U+2015> and that Sondland was even less truthful in his already-amended testimony. In a fit of congressional drama <U+2015> where 'drama' is usually measured by someone using a swear on the House floor <U+2015> the Intelligence Committee announced during the hearing Wednesday that it would hear directly from that aide who overheard the conversation.Swalwell pointed to those new discoveries when HuffPost asked if Democrats were just forced to 'play out the string' with these impeachment hearings, and he thought the display could move polling and put pressure on Republicans.'Their job title is 'representative,' right?' he asked. 'Their constituents will be watching.'And yet, the developments seemed to barely register in a new media landscape where Trump can make headlines with tweets before breakfast. NBC News claimed'the hearing lacked 'pizazz.' Reuters summed it up'as 'consequential, but dull.'One of the most moderate Republicans left in Congress, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, didn't seem to be feeling any new pressure after the first day of hearings. In fact, he thought it would be moderate Democrats who would be struggling more than the few moderates on his side.'For some of the Democrats, the inquiry vote was easier than impeachment,' Fitzpatrick said.The only Independent in Congress, Justin Amash of Michigan, who left the Republican Party in July partly over the GOP's fealty to Trump, told HuffPost that Democrats needed to steer these hearings more toward the damning facts and less toward partisan policy disputes. He was particularly concerned with how much time Democrats spent on establishing how important the security aid was for Ukraine.'That plays into the Republican argument that it's just a policy dispute, there are just some bureaucrats who disagree with the president on policy and that's all it is,' Amash said. 'And that's not the case. That's not what actually happened. But Democrats sort of played into that with the testimony, or at least the order of the questioning.'Part of the reason Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) spent so much time on the importance of the aid was because the two witnesses underscored it themselves in their opening statements <U+2015> and because Taylor actually suggested at one point that Ukrainians might have died because the United States had delayed that aid.Taylor eventually walked that claim back a bit, ultimately noting that the aid helped Ukraine fight Russia and that Ukrainian soldiers were dying each week in that conflict, but the discussion eventually led to Republicans noting the lack of aid under President Barack Obama.Democrats understand they are in a different world, where Republicans can make bad-faith arguments, or mislead, or simply bring up conspiracy theories as a response to a clear case of the president breaking the law.But they don't believe there's any novel way to respond, other than to just proceed with their hearings and their impeachment vote.When we asked Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), who sits on the Intelligence Committee and perhaps had the most viral moment of the first day, whether Democrats should consider using more of the GOP playbook, he became thoughtful.'This actually is a very serious question, it's not just a tactical question,' Welch said. 'Should we imitate their approach? The serious dilemma we face in a democracy is that there is a shattering of norms. And you need norms, and you need some mutual respect, in order to sustain a democracy.'Welch said one of the clearest examples of the 'shattering of norms' on impeachment was when acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney held a press conference in which he essentially admitted there was a quid pro quo and advised Democrats to 'get over it.''If we go to those tactics, a) we lose. But, b) we will be accelerating the deterioration of the norms and trust that we need to sustain a democracy,' Welch said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The report cited a well-connected Republican source as saying 'Rudy will be cut loose because he was rogue.'Asked by The Guardian whether he believed Trump would remain loyal to him, Giuliani said he believed the president to be a 'very loyal guy.'''I did what a good lawyer is supposed to do,' Giuliani reportedly said. 'I dug up evidence that helped to show the case against him was false; that there was a great deal of collusion going on someplace else other than Russia.

"118",1445471927,"Trump Defenders Portray Him As A Corruption Fighter, Only … He’s Not","WASHINGTON <U+2015> Republicans settling in to defend the president's actions in Ukraine as part of 'anti-corruption' efforts face one small problem: There is no evidence that Donald Trump has evinced interest in ending corruption anywhere in the world, ever.Trump and his defenders have cloaked his efforts to use $391 million in military aid to the besieged nation as leverage to try to coerce Ukraine to conduct politically useful investigations as simply an attempt to clean up corruption there.'President Trump outraged the bureaucracy by acting skeptically about foreign aid and expressing concerns about foreign corruption,' House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said in his opening statement at Wednesday's first public impeachment hearing.Republican Rep. Mark Meadows, a top Trump ally from North Carolina, told reporters afterward, 'The president has a deep-rooted concern about corruption.'Trump himself, during an Oct. 4 media availability, said his sole interest was corruption: 'I don't care about politics, but I do care about corruption.'And this whole thing is about corruption.'This whole thing <U+2015> this whole thing is about corruption.'But asked what other corruption he has sought to root out, Trump responded, 'You know, we would have to look.'If the White House actually did try to look, it appears not to have found anything. Despite numerous queries over a number of weeks, Trump's aides did not provide HuffPost a single instance in which the president has concerned himself with ending corruption anywhere on the planet.His critics were not surprised.'Trump has never been concerned with corruption in Ukraine or anywhere else, except when it directly relates to furthering his petty political interests,' said Ned Price, a onetime CIA analyst and a spokesperson for the National Security Council under former President Barack Obama.According to witness testimony as well as the rough transcript of Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, Trump demanded that Ukraine investigate the Democrat he most feared as a 2020 opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as support a conspiracy theory which falsely claims that Russian intelligence agencies did not help Trump win the 2016 election but rather it was Ukrainian officials who framed Russia using fake evidence. He made the congressionally approved aid contingent on Ukraine publicly announcing the probes but then backed down after the White House learned that a whistleblower's complaint on the matter was about to reach Congress.George Kent, the State Department official in charge of anti-corruption efforts around the world, said Trump's demands make it much harder for U.S. diplomats to insist that countries, including those receiving U.S. aid, implement reforms.'There's an issue of credibility. They hear diplomats on the ground saying one thing and they hear other U.S. leaders saying something else,' Kent testified Wednesday.Leaders in other nations are also fully aware that Trump has openly made money off his presidency through his hotels and golf courses, with dozens of countries using his hotel a few blocks from the White House during official visits to the city. Trump has also profited from the U.S. government, which must pay his properties for the room and board of Secret Service, State Department and other officials when Trump chooses to visit his resorts. Trump even awarded himself an eight-figure contract to host the next Group of Seven summit at his own golf course next to the Miami airport before backing down in the face of negative media coverage.Ironically, that precise type of behavior was described as corrupt during Wednesday's hearing by both Kent and the Republican staff lawyer questioning him.'He used his regulatory authority to award gas exploration licenses to companies that he, himself, controlled,' Kent said of a former Ukrainian minister of energy. 'That would be considered an act of corruption in my view, yes.''Certainly self-dealing,' agreed Steve Castor, who was questioning witnesses on behalf of GOP committee members.In fact, Trump's own self-dealing, critics said, means that if he really wanted to find corruption, he could start by looking in the mirror.'President Trump is certainly interested in corruption, but we haven't seen evidence that his interest extends to ending it,' said Jordan Libowitz, with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. 'Ending corruption starts at home, or five blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue, as the case may be.''Trump has ended corruption as we know it,' added Robert Weissman, president of the liberal group Public Citizen. 'Instead, he's introduced a hyper-corruption involving personal enrichment, abuse of power, constitutional transgression and a handover of government power to corporations on a scale that so far exceeds past history that it has entered an entirely new realm.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"119",1445471924,"5 Things To Know Before Marie Yovanovitch’s Testimony In Impeachment Hearing","The House Intelligence Committee is preparing to hear Friday from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, the third witness to publicly testify in the impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump.'Yovanovitch's hearing comes after diplomats Bill Taylor and George Kent publicly testified Wednesday for six hours about Trump's attempt to freeze U.S. military aid to Ukraine until the country agreed to publicly commit to investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for president.Yovanovitch was removed in May as ambassador in Kyiv after Republicans complained that she was undermining efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Trump's political rivals. She privately testified Oct. 11 in the impeachment investigation, in which she said the president was politically motivated to pressure the State Department to remove her.Here are five things to know before watching the House's public impeachment hearing with Yovanovitch:'Yovanovitch was abruptly removed from her post on May 6 despite being scheduled to end her stint there months later. The removal came after conservative media outlets and Donald Trump Jr. accused her of being part of an alleged Ukrainian attempt to support Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in the 2016 election, which she denied.'The veteran foreign service officer said her ouster happened after she insisted to Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani that his requests for Ukraine to conduct certain investigations be relayed through the proper foreign policy channels. After Yovanovitch was removed, Giuliani announced that he would be traveling to Ukraine.At the time of her ouster, Democrats slammed the decision as a 'political hit job.' Yovanovitch is still employed by the State Department and currently holds a fellowship at Georgetown University.Yovanovitch privately testified that Trump pressured the State Department to fire her as a 'concerted campaign against me' because she refused to allow Giuliani's shadow diplomacy.She said she was 'incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an Ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.'She was replaced by Bill Taylor, the charg' d'affaires to Ukraine, who testified Wednesday about his concerns regarding Trump and Giuliani's backchannel to the country.Despite her being a nonpartisan career official, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee will likely attempt to discredit Yovanovitch by bringing up the false rumors that led to her removal: that she was actively anti-Trump.'In Trump's infamous July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky <U+2015> the call that helped fuel the impeachment inquiry <U+2015> the U.S. president threatened Yovanovitch by calling her 'bad news' and ominously saying she was 'going to go through some things.' Zelensky said he didn't support Yovanovitch because Trump told him she 'was a bad ambassador.'At her private hearing, Yovanovitch testified that she felt shocked and threatened by the president's comments. She said a senior Ukrainian official warned her that 'I really needed to watch my back.''The summary of the Ukraine call suggested that Trump was angry at Yovanovitch on the basis of claims made by Ukraine's former top prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko.Yovanovitch testified that Ukrainian officials told her at the end of last year that Giuliani was communicating with Lutsenko 'and that they had plans, and that they were going to, you know, do things, including to me.' She added that Lutsenko 'was looking to hurt me in the U.S.''Yovanovitch said that Giuliani went behind her back to try to replace her by meeting with former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko. Lutsenko was Giuliani's initial point of contact in persuading Ukraine to investigate the Bidens after Yovanovitch refused to help him.According to The New York Times, Lutsenko had a personal animus toward Yovanovitch while he was Ukraine's prosecutor general because of her complaints that his office was filled with corrupt employees. She also reportedly told Lutsenko to stop investigating anti-corruption activists who were critical of his work and were supported by the American Embassy. Lutsenko snapped at Yovanovitch, telling her that 'no one is going to dictate to me' who should be investigated, according to the Times.Lutsenko falsely accused Yovanovitch of interfering with the 2016 elections by giving him a 'do not prosecute' list and blocking Ukraine from giving evidence of corruption in the election to the U.S. He later admitted that he was the one who requested the list'but still communicated the rumors to Trump's inner circle, eventually resulting in Yovanovitch's ouster.Lutsenko was fired in August by Zelensky, and Ukrainian authorities said in October that they're investigating him for allegedly abusing his power in dealings with politicians.'Yovanovitch privately testified that Giuliani's business associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman coordinated with him in trying to replace her with someone more favorably inclined toward their 'business dealings in Ukraine.'Parnas and Fruman, Soviet-born Florida businessmen, allegedly set up the meetings between Giuliani and Lutsenko. They also managed to help build congressional support for removing Yovanovitch, including from Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), who sent a letter urging Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to remove the ambassador because of allegations she was anti-Trump.'I didn't understand that because nobody at the embassy had ever met those two individuals,' Yovanovitch testified of Parnas and Fruman. 'And you know, one of the biggest jobs of an American ambassador of the U.S. Embassy is to promote U.S. business. So of course, if legitimate business comes to us, you know that's what we do, we promote U.S. business.'She said Ukraine's Interior Minister Arsen Avakov warned her that Giuliani had sought a meeting with him but he refused out of discomfort with the attorney's activities.Yovanovitch alleged that Parnas and Fruman were looking to export liquid natural gas to Ukraine, which the embassy usually supports. But a Ukrainian official told her in February 2018 that Giuliani and the associates were also attempting a 'very dangerous' move by looking into Ukraine's involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. That led the businessmen to consider her an obstacle in their reported scheme to purge the leadership of Naftogaz, Ukraine's national oil and gas company.Parnas and Fruman were recently indicted on charges of making campaign contributions to a Trump-aligned super PAC using straw donors last year.Parnas said Nov. 4 that he was prepared to cooperate with the House's subpoena after Trump openly denied knowing him at the time of his arrest. He also alleged Nov. 11 that he himself directly told Ukrainian officials that military aid was contingent on the Biden investigation.'Secretary of State Mike Pompeo oversaw Yovanovitch's abrupt removal. Many of the diplomats who have testified said that they voiced concern over the fact that the State Department did not come to Yovanovitch's defense when she was disparaged and eventually removed from her post. Some of those witnesses included Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs George Kent, who testified Wednesday, and Pompeo's former senior adviser Michael McKinley.'Yovanovitch testified that she went to Pompeo to seek a reaffirming public statement of support after the barrage of negative press and the disparagement that she felt undermined her credibility. The State Department told her there was 'caution about any kind of statement, because it could be undermined' by a Trump tweet.David Hale, the third-ranking official at the State Department, testified to the House that the department believed publicly defending Yovanovitch would have hurt efforts to lift Trump's freeze on military aid to Ukraine and that senior officials were concerned about Giuliani's reaction.Yovanovitch also said Thomas Ulrich Brechbuhl, the State Department's counselor, was in charge of handling her removal but that he refused to meet with her when she came back to Washington.McKinley testified to the House that he resigned partly due to the State Department's lack of support for Yovanovitch and the agency's increased politicization.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"121",1445538294,"Republicans Who Demanded Public Impeachment Hearings Are Still Not Happy","One of the key objections Republicans have raised against the House impeachment inquiry over the past month is the way Democrats have run it: secretly, behind closed doors'and without sufficient opportunities for President Donald Trump to defend himself.But now that House impeachment investigators have begun holding public hearings, with a handful more scheduled next week, Republicans say they're still not satisfied.'It looks to me like, so far, the [Democrats] are going to give about as much due process to the president as the federal government gave our Japanese-American friends during World War II,' Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said Tuesday, comparing the impeachment process to the tragic forced relocation and incarceration in concentration camps of people of Japanese ancestry.Republican lawmakers in Wednesday's blockbuster impeachment hearing on Capitol Hill were allowed to question witnesses, as they did during closed-door proceedings, and make motions to call their own witnesses. Trump's lawyers were not allowed to participate, but Democrats say the president will be represented once the probe reaches the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over articles of impeachment. White House lawyers will also be allowed to defend the president during a Senate trial if the House impeaches Trump.Republican senators also weren't swayed by the substance of the testimony given at the hearing on Wednesday by Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary for Europe and Eurasian affairs. Both Taylor and Kent gave information corroborating allegations initially made by an intelligence community whistleblower that Trump attempted to withhold U.S. military aid to Ukraine until the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of his 2020 rivals.Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) insisted Trump did nothing wrong by urging Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, however. The senator called the veteran civil servants 'nice guys' who 'probably mean well.' But he, too, dismissed their testimony, arguing that they disagreed with Trump simply because they found his style 'too out of the box' and because the way the president operates 'violates what they believe about their own superiority.'Under questioning on Wednesday, both Taylor and Kent denied being 'Never Trumpers,' as Trump has alleged on Twitter. Both officials are widely accomplished diplomats who have served both Republican and Democratic presidents.But Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) said he found Taylor and Kent 'credible only in the sense that I think they interpreted this the way they saw it,' disagreeing with their belief that Trump held up aid to Ukraine while pushing an investigation into the Bidens. He further called the hearing 'a bad day for the folks who were trying to build a case' for impeachment because it allowed Republicans to voice their objections in public.Throughout the impeachment hearing on Wednesday, House Republicans remarked that Taylor and Kent's testimony can't be taken seriously because they are not direct witnesses of any wrongdoing by Trump. Republican senators echoed that argument when pressed for their views on the matter.'Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kansas), for example, dismissed their accounts, stating that the hearing seemed like 'it was more hearsay than anything else.'In reality, however, the White House has blocked witnesses who might have firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing from testifying before impeachment investigators: officials like former national security adviser John Bolton, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney.Asked Thursday if he wanted to hear from someone with firsthand knowledge of the matter, a witness who could offer a defense of Trump and clear up any questions senators may have about the freeze on Ukraine aid, Cramer said he agreed with the White House decision to invoke executive privilege and block top administration officials from testifying.'It doesn't get more firsthand than the transcript of the call,' Cramer said, arguing that Trump's July 25 call summary with Zelensky shows no quid pro quo involving Ukraine aid.'I think it's appropriate to exercise it in whatever the case might be,' he added of the invocation of executive privilege.Several more witnesses are scheduled to testify in public in the coming week that Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine as he pushed a probe into the Bidens, including former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch,'National Security Council official Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, Trump's European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland, and Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser to the White House.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Fox News host Laura Ingraham even said on her show this week that bribery was specifically named as an impeachable offense in the Constitution, but 'attempted bribery is not.''Bill Oakley, a writer and showrunner on 'The Simpsons,' wrote in The Washington Post that this argument calls to mind the defense used by the malevolent cartoon character Sideshow Bob when he was jailed for attempted murder.'He quoted the character:'Convicted of a crime I didn't even commit.

I have many friends in Ukraine who know you and like you,' Trump told Zelensky, according to the White House memo summarizing the call.The release of the summary comes as the White House continues to stymie lawmakers' demands for documents and witnesses related to the impeachment inquiry. The White House has continued to stonewall the inquiry and has tried to delegitimize Democrats' efforts.The April call was the first between the two presidents, preceding'the July 25 conversation in which Trump asked Ukraine's newly elected leader to investigate Trump's presidential rival Joe Biden. The White House released a summary of that call in September.Trump mentioned his first call with the newly elected Ukrainian leader at a news conference on Sept. 25. 'I spoke to [Zelensky] previous to the call that we released, which was a very innocent call,' Trump said. 'Very, very innocent, very nice call.'The April 21 call is also referenced in a whistleblower complaint, the redacted version of which was released on Sept. 26.The bombshell complaint alleged Trump was abusing the power of his office by pressuring foreign governments, specifically Ukraine, to interfere in U.S. elections. During Trump's call with Zelensky in July ' when he asked his counterpart to investigate Biden and his son ' the U.S. was withholding congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine.Involved U.S. diplomats have testified that the decision was an attempted quid pro quo.The House launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump after the release of the whistleblower's complaint, and Congress has now spoken to numerous witnesses who have corroborated the whistleblower's account.Trump said Saturday he would release a transcript of his April call with Zelensky and claimed it was 'very important.''You'll read the second. call, and you'll tell me if there's anything wrong with it,' he said.Read the White House summary of the April call below:'Liza Hearon contributed reporting.This is a developing story.

Trump's request, documented in a rough transcript of his July 25 call with Zelensky, is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.Yovanovitch told legislators she was dismissed following a 'smear campaign against me' orchestrated by Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and promulgated by the right-wing media.That included Giuliani's unsubstantiated allegation that Yovanovitch gave a 'do not prosecute' list to Ukrainian officials in an effort to protect Americans.

She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President's absolute right to appoint ambassadors.Yovanovitch served the U.S. for 33 years prior to her abrupt dismissal by Trump this May, including posts in regions like Mogadishu, Somalia, amid the civil war there; Tashkent, Uzbekistan, where she says the embassy building was sprayed with gunfire; and an attempted coup in Moscow in 1993, where she testified she was once literally 'caught in crossfire between presidential and parliamentary forces.'Regarding Trump's claim that Ukrainian President'Volodymyr Zelensky''spoke unfavorably' about Yovanovitch, the rough transcript of their July 25 call shows Trump'smearing her reputation to Zelensky, not the other way around.....They call it 'serving at the pleasure of the President.'

With all of that, however, I have done FAR more for Ukraine than O.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) briefly interrupted his counsel's questioning to give Yovanovitch time to respond to the tweets.'I ' I don't think I have such powers,' a clearly baffled Yovanovitch said, responding to the accusation that 'everywhere [she] went turned bad.''I think that where I served over the years, I and others have demonstrably made things better for the U.S. as well as for the countries that I've served in,' she continued.'Ukraine, for example where there are huge challenges, including on the issue we're discussing today of corruption ' they've made a lot of progress since 2014. The Ukrainian people get a lot of credit for that. Part of that also goes to the United States and to me, as the ambassador in Ukraine.'During a brief recess taken for committee members to attend a vote, Schiff told the media that Trump's tweets were an attempt at 'witness intimidation in real time by the president of the United States.'Rep.

It is strikingly different from the following July 25 call between the two leaders that has become the focus of the House impeachment inquiry, in which Trump repeatedly brought up the 2016 election and former Vice President Joe Biden, his political rival.'I think you will do a great job. I have many friends in Ukraine who know you and like you,' Trump told Zelensky on the April call.There was no mention of eliminating corruption in Ukraine in their conversation, even though Trump and his allies have frequently cited the president's supposed concern about corruption as one of the reasons he held up military aid to the country.Trump did, however, tout his former ownership of the international Miss Universe beauty pageant.'When I owned Miss Universe, they always had great people.

And the lawmaker previously'mentioned the titillating topic during a September hearing regarding the whistleblower complaint'about Trump's phone call with Ukraine's president'that kicked the impeachment process into high gear.Nunes' comments appear to stem from a 2017 call made to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) from two Russian pranksters claiming to represent the Ukrainian government, which The Atlantic reported on early last year. They claimed to have 'compromising' information on Trump that included, among other things, nude photos of Trump with a Russian celebrity. Schiff responded that he would try to work with the FBI to obtain the information.A spokesman for Schiff told The Atlantic for the magazine's 2018 article that upon receiving the call, the House Intelligence Committee had immediately 'informed appropriate law-enforcement and security personnel of the conversation, and of our belief that it was probably bogus.'At the time of the call, Schiff was the ranking Democrat on the then-Republican-controlled Intelligence Committee. With Democrats now holding the House majority, Schiff chairs the panel and is overseeing its impeachment inquiry.One Twitter user sensed that Nunes' willingness to dwell on the nude photo matter might inspire a writing opportunity:This is the second time Devin Nunes has mentioned nude photos of Trump. Three times and it's a New York Times style section trend piece.Others thought Nunes' naked accusations were sending some kind of secret Bat-signal.Devin Nunes seems to enjoy talking about ""nude pictures of Trump.""

"135",1446272900,"Marie Yovanovitch Explains How Trump Opened The Door For Corruption","President Donald Trump's decision to remove the former ambassador to Ukraine from her post over bad-faith smears dramatically undermined U.S. efforts to fight corruption worldwide, she told Congress in a public impeachment hearing Friday morning.'Over hours of testimony, Marie Yovanovitch described how the Trump administration bought into and advanced a coordinated campaign of lies about her launched by a'Ukrainian official accused of corruption, right-wing pundits and'Trump's own lawyer. Trump warned that Yovanovitch was 'going to go through some things''on his now-infamous July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.Even as Yovanovitch testified, Trump continued to attack the career foreign service officer who had served under every president since Ronald Reagan. 'Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,' he tweeted. The president's live commentary led House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to interrupt the hearing and ask Yovanovitch what she thought of his tweet. 'It's very intimidating,' she said.But Trump's attacks only bolstered Yovanovitch's argument. As Trump tweeted, Yovanovitch told Congress that although the campaign against her was not based in fact, Trump had given U.S. enemies worldwide a road map for how to remove U.S. officials they don't like.'Shady interests, the world over, have learned how little it takes to remove an American ambassador who does not give them what they want,' Yovanovitch testified on Friday.'The process Yovanovitch described is simple:Invent some barely plausible lies about the U.S. official you don't like. (In Yovanovitch's case, this was the smear that, rather than fighting against corrupt Ukrainian officials, she was actually trying to discourage investigations of corruption, particularly against Trump's political rivals.)Make sure the lies validate the president's beliefs. (For example, that a 'deep state' of government officials is out to get him.)'Next, get the attention of someone close to the president.'(Former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, discussed Yovanovitch ' and her supposed lack of loyalty ' with a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor. Giuliani's associates went on to spread rumors about Yovanovitch disparaging the president.Make sure your smear gets to the American right-wing press. (In this case, the key figure was John Solomon, then an opinion contributor to The Hill.)Finally, get that smear onto Fox News. (Solomon took the smears about Yovanovitch straight to Sean Hannity's show, where he appears regularly.)'The smear campaign against Yovanovitch worked remarkably quickly.Late last year, the ambassador began hearing from Ukrainian officials that Giuliani was in touch with Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's prosecutor general at the time. In an earlier closed-door hearing, Yovanovitch testified that a senior Ukrainian official had told her that 'I really need to watch my back.''She was told that Giuliani and Lutsenko 'had plans, and that they were going to, you know, do things, including to me,' she said.'Giuliani and his associates started planting false rumors that Yovanovitch was an Obama administration loyalist who used her post in Ukraine to undercut Trump. The false allegations became public in March when Solomon quoted Lutsenko claiming that Yovanovitch gave him a list of people he should not prosecute. The claim ' which Lutsenko later retracted ''helped fuel right-wing rumors that Democrats had pressured Ukrainian officials to ignore wrongdoing by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company headed by an oligarch accused of corruption.Trump ' who believes he is the victim of a so-called deep state conspiracy by Democrats who colluded with Ukraine to block him from becoming president ' was receptive to this false rumor. He and his son both tweeted about Solomon's story shortly after it went up. (The Hill has not updated Solomon's original story to reflect Lutsenko's retraction.)Yovanovitch knew it would be impossible for her to effectively represent U.S. policy in Ukraine with the president and his son publicly denouncing her, she testified on Friday. She tried to get Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to issue a statement of support but learned that he declined to do so out of concern that Trump would undermine that statement in another tweet.'Soon Yovanovitch began hearing ominous warnings about 'concern' from her colleagues back in Washington. She received a phone call at 1 a.m. in April, after hosting a dinner honoring a Ukrainian anti-corruption activist, ordering her to take the next flight back to D.C.'Once she returned, she met with Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who told her Trump had lost confidence in her.'''Individuals ... were able to successfully conduct a campaign of disinformation against a sitting ambassador, using unofficial back channels,' Yovanovitch said Friday. 'They shared baseless allegations with the president and convinced him to remove his ambassador, despite the fact that the State Department fully understood that the allegations were false and the sources highly suspect.'Yovanovitch asked Sullivan how he would explain her removal from Ukraine. 'Everybody is watching,' she said. 'If people see that I, who have been promoting our policies on anti-corruption ' if they can undermine me and get me pulled out of Ukraine, what does that mean for our policy?'Sullivan didn't have an answer, she testified. Yovanovitch said her ouster sets a dangerous global precedent. 'When other countries, other actors ' see that private interests, foreign interests can come together and get a U.S. ambassador removed, what's going to stop them from doing that in the future in other countries?''Trump's crusade against Yovanovitch wasn't limited to derailing her career. The president told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky that Yovanovitch was a bad ambassador and that 'she's going to go through some things,' according to a White House transcript of a July 25 phone call. During that same call, Trump praised Lutsenko, the prosecutor-general who helped spread false information about Yovanovitch and who was dismissed by Ukraine's parliament the following month.'Yovanovitch first learned about Trump bad-mouthing her to another foreign leader when the White House released the call transcript in September. It felt like a vague threat from the president, she said on Friday.'Trump, whose spokesperson said the president didn't plan on watching Yovanovtich's testimony, continued attacking the former ambassador as she testified. 'She started off in Somalia, how did that go?' he'tweeted during the hearing.'Asked by Schiff if Trump's real-time attacks would influence other witnesses' willingness to testify in the impeachment inquiry, Yovanovitch responded, 'I can't speak to what the president is trying to do, but I think the effect is to be intimidating.''Trump denied his tweet constituted witness intimidation. 'I have the right to speak, I have freedom of speech, just as other people do,' he said.Fox News' Bret Baier, typically a reliable Trump ally,'appeared to disagree.''The whole hearing turned on a dime when Trump tweeted about her,' Baier said. Trump's tweet allowed Schiff to characterize the president's behavior as witness intimidation or witness tampering, Baier continued.

In her testimony, she said that her efforts to root out corruption had intimidated Ukrainians, and for that reason they wanted her dismissed.Wallace's emphasis on Yovanovitch's career is a significant break from the overall Fox News focus on the efforts by Republican lawmakers to downplay and discount the seemingly damning revelations about Trump's conduct provided by witnesses in the impeachment inquiry.Yovanovitch was fired shortly before Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during which Trump requested Zelensky's government conduct a corruption probe of former Vice President Joe Biden'<U+2015>the potential 2020 Democratic presidential nominee <U+2015> and Biden's son based on unfounded allegations about their overseas business dealings. Trump's push for such an investigation is the focus of the impeachment inquiry, examining whether he improperly attempted to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election and used the threat of withholding U.S. financial aid to prod Ukraine to target a political rival.A rough transcript of the July call shows that Trump sympathized with Zelensky's dislike of Yovanovitch, calling her 'bad news.'During Yovanovitch's Friday testimony, Trump berated her on Twitter, claiming that 'everywhere' she went as a diplomat 'turned bad.' He also noted that as president, he is entitled to select ambassadors as he sees fit.Responding to the tweets as she testified, Yovanovitch told lawmakers, 'I can't speak to what the president is trying to do, but I think the effect is to be intimidating.'Brett Baier, another Fox News anchor, said on Twitter that Trump's comment 'ripping' Yovanovitch gave Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) the chance to point it out, 'characterizing it as witness tampering or intimidation <U+2015> adding an article of impeachment real-time.'Defending his remarks, Trump asserted at a brief afternoon press conference that impeachment is 'a political process, it's not a legal process,' and, 'I'm allowed to speak up.'This story has been updated with Baier's remarks and Trump's press conference statement.",2019-11-15 15:32:32
"138",1446368016,"State Department Official Says He Overheard Trump Call About Ukraine ‘Investigations’","WASHINGTON (AP) ' A State Department official told impeachment investigators Friday that he overheard President Donald Trump talking with a U.S. ambassador about 'investigations' in Ukraine, according to people familiar with the testimony.David Holmes, the political counsel at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, said Trump was talking so loudly that Ambassador Gordon Sondland had to hold the phone from his ear.Holmes said that allowed others at a restaurant in Kyiv to overhear the call that's now part of the impeachment inquiry, according to one of the people, who were unauthorized to publicly discuss the testimony and were granted anonymity.The conversation at the Kyiv restaurant came the day after Trump's July 25 phone call with newly elected Ukraine President Volodymy Zelenskiy, in which the U.S. president pressed his counterpart to investigate Democrats and 2020 rival Joe Biden. A whistleblower's complaint about that call sparked the impeachment inquiry.Sondland opened the July 26 conversation by telling Trump that the Zelenskiy 'loves your ass.'Trump responded, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?''He's gonna do it,' Sondland replied.The Associated Press has viewed key excerpts of Holmes' 10-page statement and a person familiar with the document confirmed its authenticity. The remarks were first obtained by CNN.Holmes, a career foreign service officer, told investigators he did not seek the opportunity to testify. Like others in the inquiry, he was issued a subpoena to appear. He spent nearly seven hours with lawmakers.Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., said Holmes is a key witness to the impeachment investigation because he heard directly from Trump. That counters Republican complaints that the inquiry is based on hearsay from other officials testifying.'He has firsthand knowledge of the conversation between Ambassador Sondland and the president of the United States,' Lieu said. 'He overheard the conversation.'After the call with Trump, which Sondland placed from his mobile phone at the outdoor table over lunch with Holmes and two other people, he remarked the president was in a 'bad mood.'Holmes asked the ambassador if it's true that Trump 'doesn't give a shit about Ukraine.'Sondland told him the president did not 'give a shit about Ukraine.' The president only cares about 'big stuff,' Sondland said.When the foreign service officer noted the importance of Ukraine, at war with Russia, Sondland clarified that he meant stuff that benefits the president, like the 'Biden investigation.' Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was pushing the Ukrainians to investigate former Vice President Biden.Holmes' job often required him to be the official note-taker at meetings. He said while he did not take notes from the lunch with Sondland, he has a 'clear recollection' and believes other colleagues at the table do as well.The Associated Press has already identified one of the other people who heard the call as Suriya Jayanti, a foreign service officer based in Kyiv.Like other officials who have testified in the inquiry, he expressed alarm at the shifting situation in Ukraine with Giuliani's influence.Holmes, who testified after Friday's public hearing with ousted U.S. Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yonvakovitch, told investigators he had never seen anything like the campaign that led to her May recall.The situation in Kyiv changed dramatically in spring, he said. Key policies, including resistance to Russian aggression, 'became overshadowed by a political agenda being promoted by Rudy Giuliani' and others 'with a direct channel to the White House.'Ahead of one meeting, Sondland said: 'Dammit Rudy. Every time Rudy gets involved he goes and f<U+2015>-s everything up.'Holmes said he heard John Bolton, the National Security Adviser, tell others about his frustration with Giuliani's influence with the president. Bolton told William Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine, to send a first-person cable to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the situation.Holmes first came to investigators' attention after Taylor, the acting head of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, testified Wednesday that a staff member overheard the conversation. The person was later identified as Holmes.Holmes, who joined the Foreign Service in 2002, has served in Afghanistan, Colombia, India, Kosovo and Russia as well as on the National Security Council staff in Washington.He won an award for constructive dissent from the American Foreign Service Association in 2014 for complaining about problems that an alternate diplomatic channel had caused in South Asia and recommending organizational changes to the State Department's bureaucratic structure for the region.Holmes made his concerns known through the State Department's so-called 'Dissent Channel,' which provides diplomats with a confidential way of registering serious concerns.It's similar to but distinct from the method ' a personal cable to the secretary of state ' that Taylor used to register his objections about Ukraine policy.__Associated Press writers Matthew Lee and Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"139",1446389932,"Trump Watches Helplessly As The ‘Deep State’ He’s Disparaged Wreaks Its Revenge","WASHINGTON <U+2015> Donald Trump got another lesson on the limits of the presidency Friday as yet another executive branch member in his employ offered damaging testimony in his impeachment inquiry, despite his vow last month that his administration would not cooperate at all.For six hours, ousted ambassador Marie Yovanovitch described to the House Intelligence Committee how she was fired by Trump after his personal lawyer and his now-indicted business partners smeared her reputation in Ukraine and lobbied for her dismissal. It came two days after two other State Department diplomats took their stories to Capitol Hill about Trump's efforts to tie military aid to Ukraine to an investigation he wanted into the Democrat he most feared as a 2020 presidential opponent.'He is not a king, and this is not the Trump Organization,' said Bradley Moss, a national security lawyer who often represents federal employees in administrative matters. 'The president is learning the harsh truth that civil servants ultimately report to the office of the president, not the officeholder, and there are limits to their willingness to stay silent in the face of abuses of power.'At least a dozen officials, including at least two political appointees, have appeared before the House Intelligence Committee already, both in closed-door depositions and, beginning this week, in public, televised hearings.Just five weeks ago, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi: 'President Trump cannot permit his administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances.'The White House did not respond to HuffPost queries regarding that letter's apparent ineffectiveness.Someone who refuses to honor a congressional subpoena risks being held in contempt of Congress, which results in, at the very least, hefty legal bills. Someone who honors the subpoena risks being fired. The latter choice, though, can make the subpoenaed witness seem more sympathetic to the public while making the White House appear both vindictive and secretive.'Aside from firing them or revoking their clearance, the president has no power to unilaterally do anything against these individuals,' Moss said.Trump, meanwhile, took matters into his own hands Friday, attacking Yovanovitch on Twitter as she began her testimony. He later defended that action and denied that it was designed to intimidate her or others. 'I have the right to speak. I have freedom of speech just as other people do,' he said during a White House photo opportunity.Though some of Trump's top aides, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, have refused to comply with congressional subpoenas and some executive branch agencies, such as the Office of Management and Budget and the State Department, have refused to turn over requested documents, a growing list of officials from State, the National Security Council and the Defense Department have honored House demands to testify. On Saturday, an official from OMB, Mark Sandy, is scheduled to be the first from that office to appear for a deposition.Trump has frequently disparaged career professionals in the federal government, particularly those in national security agencies including the intelligence community, the State Department and the Justice Department and FBI, as members of a 'Deep State' that is trying to thwart his agenda and force him from office. His defenders outside the White House and in friendly media have gone as far as to accuse them of engaging in a 'coup.'Ned Price, a onetime CIA analyst and an NSC spokesperson under former President Barack Obama, said those testifying are only carrying out their duties as they swore to do them. 'Trump is learning that, while he retains the loyalty of his senior staffers, career public servants have and always will remain faithful to the Constitution and the rule of law,' he said. 'That's why it's unsurprising that they've complied with lawful subpoenas from a co-equal branch of government.'Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the House after a whistleblower filed a complaint that the president was withholding $391 million in congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine unless its leaders announced investigations politically useful to Trump's 2020 reelection.According to witness testimony as well as the rough transcript of Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, Trump demanded that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden as well as support a conspiracy theory which falsely claims that Russian intelligence agencies did not help Trump win the 2016 election, but rather it was Ukrainian officials who framed Russia by using fake evidence. He made the military aid contingent on Ukraine publicly announcing the probes but then backed down after the White House learned that the whistleblower's complaint on the matter was about to reach Congress.'I think Trump's overall war against public servants <U+2015> the intelligence community, federal law enforcement, diplomats, etc. <U+2015> is finally beginning to bite him in the ass, and we're beginning to see a few of these patriots finally publicly fight back,' said former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh, who is running against Trump for the 2020 GOP nomination. 'There will be more. Trump can't stop them. All he can do is try to intimidate them with a tweet. But he's finding out that his angry tweets are no longer as effective as they used to be.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here's how.",2019-11-15 18:53:41
"140",1446411976,"5 Important Takeaways From Marie Yovanovitch's Testimony","President Donald Trump escalated his attacks on'Marie Yovanovitch, the ousted U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, on Friday as she testified before the House Intelligence Committee.Before her testimony, Yovanovitch had already faced smears from Trump and his allies. During his infamous call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump said Yovanovitch was 'bad news' and that she was 'going to go through some things.'Yovanovitch was recalled from her ambassadorship in May after conservative pundits promoted unfounded claims that she was part of a Ukrainian attempt to boost Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election.The former ambassador, who has served as a foreign service officer for 33 years under six presidents, has denied that claim.Here are five key moments from her hearing on Friday.As Yovanovitch testified, Trump launched an attack on her reputation in a pair of tweets. Shortly afterward, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) read the tweets to Yovanovitch and asked her to publicly respond to them.Trump tweeted that 'everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,' and denounced her work in both Somalia and Ukraine. Trump also said the president of Ukraine 'spoke unfavorably' about her.Yovanovitch appeared taken aback by the president's remarks.''It's very intimidating,' she told Schiff. 'I can't speak to what the president is trying to do, but the effect is to be intimidating.'Asked was she thought about Trump's suggestion that 'everywhere [she] went turned bad,' Yovanovitch said,''I ' I don't think I have such powers.'She continued to defend her career:'I think that where I served over the years, I and others have demonstrably made things better for the U.S. as well as for the countries that I've served in.Ukraine, for example where there are huge challenges, including on the issue we're discussing today of corruption ' they've made a lot of progress since 2014. The Ukrainian people get a lot of credit for that. Part of that also goes to the United States and to me, as the ambassador in Ukraine.During a brief recess, Schiff slammed Trump's attacks on Yovanovitch while speaking to reporters.'We saw today witness intimidation in real time by the president of the United States,' Schiff said.As former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch testified before the House Intelligence Committee, President Trump attacked her on Twitter. Rep. Adam Schiff gave her a chance to respond.More updates here: https://t.co/rfZzSkqxSY pic.twitter.com/6rxlo5hWkWRepublicans who have staunchly defended Trump as the impeachment inquiry unfolds couldn't ignore the threatening tone of his tweets. Some concluded that the attacks on Yovanovitch were unhelpful.During this week's hearings, Republicans have steered clear of directly attacking the diplomats they were questioning.'Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), one of the most vocal Republicans during the hearings, told reporters, 'I disagree with the tweet.'''I think Ambassador Yovanovitch is a public servant like many of our public servants in the foreign service,' she said.Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wy.) also defended Yovanovitch's career, saying the former ambassador is 'clearly is somebody who's been a public servant to the United States for decades.'''I don't think the president should have done that,' Cheney told The Associated Press.Even as Republicans distanced themself from the feud, the White House stood behind Trump's tweets.White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham argued that Trump's tweets were not 'witness intimidation.' 'It was simply the President's opinion, which he is entitled to. This is not a trial, it is a partisan political process,' she said in a statement.During her hourslong testimony, Yovanovitch spoke in detail about a concerted effort to destroy her reputation as a U.S. diplomat.'Individuals ... were able to successfully conduct a campaign of disinformation against a sitting ambassador, using unofficial back channels,' Yovanovitch said, adding that the State Department knew the allegations against her were false.'She noted that Trump could have just appointed another ambassador without attacking her reputation.''The president has the right to withdraw an ambassador at any time, for any reason, but what I do wonder is why it was necessary to smear my reputation, falsely,' she said.Yovanovitch is concerned that the way she was pushed out of her position could set a new precedent that other countries and private and foreign interests might exploit.'Shady interests, the world over, have learned how little it takes to remove an American ambassador who does not give them what they want,' Yovanovitch said.Yovanovitch points out that if Trump wanted her gone, he could have just recalled her without the smear campaign to wreck her reputation. But that's how Trump works. He doesn't actually like to fire anyone, he prefers making life miserable for them so they quit.Stephen Castor, the GOP staff counsel, is tasked with cross-examining witnesses at the impeachment hearings, though his performance fell mostly flat on Friday.Castor repeatedly prodded Yovanovitch over the theory embraced by Trump and right-wing pundits that Ukrainians were working to keep Trump from winning the 2016 election.'Yovanovitch's answers did little to corroborate those allegations.Steve Castor is unwittingly leading Marie Yovanovitch through a systematic taking apart of the entire John Solomon-crafted Anti-Trump conspiracy.She told Castor that she was not aware of allegations that Ukrainians were trying to undermine Trump during her time as ambassador to the country.When asked whether there were concerns that Ukrainians were 'out to get Trump,' Yovanovitch replied, 'There weren't. We really didn't see it that way.'In another effort to get Yovanovitch to agree with his claims, Castro asked if tweets critical of Trump by a Ukranian official prove that there was a group that was 'out to get him,' noting they said 'some real nasty things.''Sometimes that happens on social media,' Yovanovitch replied, prompting laughter in the room in light of Trump's public attacks on her.GOP counsel Castor: This Ukrainian guy said some very nasty things about Trump!Marie Yovanovitch: Sometimes that happens on social media. pic.twitter.com/3VAlWyW73RYovanovitch emphasized on Friday that her ouster has shown how U.S. diplomats and U.S. policy are vulnerable to outside interference.'I still find it difficult to comprehend that foreign and private interests were able to undermine U.S. interests in this way,' she said during the hearing.'These events should concern everyone in this room,' Yovanovitch continued. 'If our chief representative is kneecapped, it limits our effectiveness to safeguard the vital national security interests of the United States.'During her testimony, Yovanovitch described the consequences of having Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and his associates spread false rumors about her alleged partisanship, eventually leading to her dismissal.'As Foreign Service professionals are being denigrated and undermined, the institution is also being degraded. This will soon cause real harm, if it hasn't already,' Yovanovitch said Friday. 'The State Department is being hollowed out from within at a competitive and complex time on the world stage. This is not a time to undercut our diplomats.'She also agreed that the entire situation has had a 'chilling' effect on those who work at the State Department.'I think it's had a chilling effect, not only in the embassy in Kyiv, but throughout the State Department because people don't know whether their efforts to pursue stated policy are going to be supported,' she said. 'And that is a dangerous place to be.'Yovanovitch: ""I think it's had a chilling effect throughout the State Dept. because people don't know whether their efforts to pursue stated policy are going to be supported.

Sondland later explained the investigations pertained to 'Bidens' ' a reference to former Vice President Joe Biden and Biden's son Hunter, who served on the board of a gas company in Ukraine. No wrongdoing by either Biden has been substantiated.It was one of the first direct accounts of Trump seeking investigations of a political rival and provides Democrats with a counterargument to Republicans, who dismiss the testimony so far as largely hearsay from diplomats and others with, at best, secondhand knowledge of events.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is sharpening the argument against the president saying his actions amount to 'bribery.'Pelosi, in an interview to air Sunday on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' said Trump 'made a mistake' by live-tweeting his criticism of Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine he ousted, during her public testimony Friday.

'The costs of this constant harassment are real.'Barr's portrayal of oversight as harassment echoes Trump's repeated claims that he is the victim of a partisan 'witch hunt' rather than the subject of a justified inquiry into his dealings with Ukraine, which remain at the heart of Democratic-led impeachment proceedings.'The fact of the matter is that, in waging a scorched earth, no-holds-barred war of resistance against this administration, it is the left that is engaged in the systematic shredding of norms and undermining the rule of law,' Barr added. 'This highlights a basic disadvantage that conservatives have had in contesting the political issues of the day.'Barr went on to invoke the ideologies of Fisher Ames, a Federalist Party politician who served as a congressman representing Massachusetts in the 1790s. Paraphrasing Ames, Barr suggested that progressives are behaving like zealots, treating 'politics as their religion:'Their holy mission is to use the coercive power of the state to remake man and society in their own image, according to an abstract ideal of perfection. Whatever means they use are therefore justified because, by definition, they are a virtuous people pursing a deific end. They are willing to use any means necessary to gain momentary advantage in achieving their end, regardless of collateral consequences and the systemic implications.'The remarks are yet another indicator that Barr <U+2015> who vowed during his January confirmation to place law, facts and good faith over politics <U+2015> isn't hesitating to take shots at those who threaten Trump's power.'The charged statements followed former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch's appearance before the House Intelligence Committee. Yovanovitch, who was recalled from her post in May, said that the president's allies, including lawyer Rudy Giuliani, had orchestrated a 'smear campaign' against her, which was spread by right-wing media.During the hearing, Trump lashed out against Yovanovitch, castigating her decades of diplomatic service on Twitter.

According to an edited transcript of the call released by the White House, Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to 'do us a favor' by looking into the Bidens. On the call, he also pushed a conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 election to the benefit of Hillary Clinton, not himself.Williams testified that, on the call, she heard Zelensky bring up Burisma,'the Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden served as a board member. Trump has alleged without evidence that Joe Biden inappropriately favored Burisma as he worked to curb corruption in Ukraine during his tenure as vice president.'The White House transcript, however, does not include Zelensky's mention of Burisma.The testimony appears to suggest that Trump used the full weight of his office to pressure Zelensky. Although Pence was initially expected to attend Zelensky's inauguration earlier this year, Williams said it was her understanding that the order to skip the inauguration had come directly from Trump.'The testimony released today shows that President Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky immediately set off alarm bells throughout the White House.

"148",1447010578,"Two New Testimonies Put Sondland At Center Of Trump Ukraine Block","WASHINGTON (AP) ' Transcripts released Saturday in the impeachment inquiry show Ambassador Gordon Sondland playing a central role in President Donald Trump's effort to push Ukraine to conduct political investigations as a condition for receiving needed military aid.The fresh details come from hundreds of pages of testimony released by House investigators from Tim Morrison, a former top official at the National Security Council. They contradict much of the ambassador's own testimony behind closed doors. Both Morrison and Sondland are expected to testify publicly before the House next week.While some, including Trump himself, have begun to question Sondland's knowledge of events, Morrison said the ambassador 'related to me he was acting ' he was discussing these matters with the President.'Morrison, a longtime Republican defense hawk in Washington, largely confirmed testimony from current and former officials testifying in the impeachment inquiry. But his account also provided new insight on what others have called a shadow diplomacy being run by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, often at odds with U.S. national security interests.As Sondland, Giuliani and others tried to persuade new Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to launch the investigations Trump wanted of his Democratic rivals, Morrison said he 'tried to stay away.'Morrison called this the Burisma 'bucket,' and it included investigations into the family of one of Trump's potential Democratic rivals, Joe Biden, and the role of Democrats in the 2016 election. It's a reference to the gas company in Ukraine where Biden's son Hunter served on the boardIn particular Morrison described a meeting Sondland held with a top Zelenskiy aide, Andriy Yermak, on the sidelines of a summit in Warsaw.Morrison said he witnessed the exchange and that afterward Sondland bounded across the room to tell him what was said.Sondland told him that 'what could help them move the aid was if the prosecutor general would go to the mike and announce that he was opening the Burisma investigation,"" Morrison testified. The prosecutor general is Ukraine's top legal official.'My concern was what Gordon was proposing about getting the Ukrainians pulled into our politics,' Morrison said. He added: 'It was the first time something like this had been injected as a condition on the release of the assistance.'Morrison, who announced Oct. 30 he would be stepping down from the NSC, was brought to the White House by then-national security adviser John Bolton.Testimony from Jennifer Williams, a special adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, also raised new questions about how much Pence knew about the alleged trade-off that's central to the impeachment inquiry.Impeachment investigators met Saturday with a White House official directly connected to Trump's block on military aid to Ukraine, the first budget office witness to testify in the historic inquiry.In the rare weekend session, lawmakers drilled into Trump's decision, against the advice of national security advisers, including Bolton, to withhold funding from the ally, a young democracy bordering hostile Russia.'It seems clear to me from everything that I've seen that the president had no interest in the defense of the Ukraine and the security of the Ukrainian people,' said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., during a break in the closed-door proceedings.Raskin said it's important for lawmakers 'to trace the bureaucratic steps' that allowed money Congress had already approved to be held up by the executive branch. 'We're in the process of chasing that down,' he said.The witness Saturday was Mark Sandy, a little-known career official at the Office of Management and Budget who was involved in key meetings about the nearly $400 million aid package Congress had approved for Ukraine.Sandy's name had barely come up in previous testimony. But it did on one particular date: July 25, the day of Trump's call with Zelenskiy. That day, a legal document with Sandy's signature directed a freeze of the security funds, according to testimony from Defense Department official Laura Cooper. Investigators had shown her a document as evidence.Trump on the call had asked Zelenskiy for a 'favor,' to conduct an investigation into Biden and his son. The link between Trump's call and the White House's holding back of security aid is the central question in the impeachment inquiry. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called it 'bribery.'Trump, who says he only wanted to root out corruption in Ukraine, says he did nothing wrong.The weeks that followed sent officials in the U.S. national security and foreign service apparatus scrambling to understand why the aid was being blocked, despite their consensus view that Zelenskiy needed the money as a show of U.S. support for his new government facing down President Vladimir Putin's Russia.'We were trying to get to the bottom of why this hold was in place, why OMB was applying this hold,' Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an Army officer at the National Security Council, told investigators. He is scheduled to testify publicly on Tuesday.Bolton derided the swap as a 'drug deal' he wanted no part of, according to closed-door testimony from Fiona Hill, the former White House Russia expert. She is set to appear Thursday.Sharpening the arguments, both sides are preparing for an intense lineup of public hearings in the coming week. Americans are deeply split over impeachment, much as they are over the president himself.For Ukraine, a former Soviet republic situated between NATO-allies and Russia, the $391 million in aid is its lifeline to the West.The money is symbolic, the ousted U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified this week, but also substantial.It includes $250 million in Pentagon funding for military hardware: sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, counter-artillery radars, electronic warfare detection, secure communications, night vision capabilities and military medical aid.An additional $141 million in State Department funding covers many of those systems as well as about $10 million to increase maritime awareness and $16.5 million for maritime security in the Black Sea, aimed at identifying and tracking Russian ships and aircraft.'Supporting Ukraine is the right thing to do,' Yovanovitch testified. 'If Russia prevails and Ukraine falls to Russian dominion, we can expect to see other attempts by Russia to expand its territory and influence.'Sandy was the first official from the Office of Management and Budget to defy Trump's instructions not to testify. Like others, he received a subpoena to appear.'When people come in, we learn more,' said Rep. Eric Swawell, D-Calif., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, as he arrived for Saturday's session.Rep. Mark Meadows, a top Trump ally, said he did not expect to hear much from Sandy, a career budget official.'All I expect him to say is he doesn't know why the aid was held and wished that he did,' said Meadows, R-N.C. 'But I may be surprised.'In a speech Friday night, Attorney General William Barr said congressional Democrats were pursuing 'scores of parallel investigations through an avalanche of subpoenas' that are 'designed to incapacitate the executive branch.'Barr, who favors an expansive view of executive power, said 'the cost of this constant harassment is real.'Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the impeachment panel, returned home Saturday to California where thousands of Democratic activists greeted him like a rock star at the state party's fall convention.""It's been an eventful week,"" he told the crowd before saying that his remarks about impeachment were no cause for celebration.""There is nothing more dangerous than an unethical president who thinks that he is above the law,"" Schiff said. ""This is a time of great peril.""___Associated Press writer Kathleen Ronayne in Long Beach, California, contributed to this report.",2019-11-16 18:33:20

"150",1447121879,"Testimony Ties Trump Closer To Pressure On Ukraine","WASHINGTON (AP) ' Gordon Sondland, President Donald Trump's emissary to the European Union, had a message when he met with a top Ukrainian official.Sondland said vital U.S. military assistance to Ukraine might be freed up if the country's top prosecutor 'would go to the mike and announce that he was opening the Burisma investigation,' a U.S. official told lawmakers. Burisma is the gas company in Ukraine where Democrat Joe Biden's son Hunter served on the board.Sondland relayed the exchange moments later to Tim Morrison, then a National Security Council aide. In his private testimony to impeachment investigators made public Saturday, Morrison recounted that Sondland also told him he was discussing the Ukraine matters directly with Trump.Morrison's testimony ties Trump more closely to the central charge from Democrats pursuing impeachment: that Trump held up U.S. military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigations into Democrats and Biden's family. Morrison's testimony also contradicts much of what Sondland told congressional investigators during his own closed-door deposition, which the ambassador later amended.Both Morrison and Sondland are scheduled to testify publicly next week as part of the historic, high-stakes impeachment proceedings into the nation's 45th president. Democrats charge that Trump abused his office for personal political gain, while the president and his allies argue that the process is politically motivated and that nothing in the testimony so far meets the bar for impeachment.Transcripts from the closed-door testimony from Morrison, a longtime Republican defense hawk in Washington, and Jennifer Williams, a special adviser to Vice President Mike Pence on Russia and Europe, were released Saturday as investigators accelerated and deepened the probe. They provided another window into the alarm within the government over Ukraine pressure.Immediately after the exchange with Sondland during an international gathering in Warsaw, Morrison called his boss, John Bolton, then Trump's national security adviser.'Stay out of it,' Bolton told him, 'brief the lawyers.'For Morrison, Burisma was a catch-all for a 'bucket' of investigations ' of Democrats and the family of Joe Biden ' that he wanted to 'stay away from.' They had nothing to do with 'the proper policy process that I was involved in on Ukraine,' he testified.Morrison said Sondland and Trump had spoken approximately five times between July 15 and Sept. 11 ' the weeks that $391 million in U.S. assistance was withheld from Ukraine before it was released.While some, including Trump himself, have begun to question Sondland's knowledge of events, Morrison told House investigators the ambassador 'related to me he was acting ' he was discussing these matters with the President.'Pressed by Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee leading the probe, as to whether Sondland had actually spoken to the president, Morrison said he had verified it each time.Pence, so far, has been a more unseen figure in the impeachment inquiry, but testimony from Williams raised fresh questions about what Pence knew about Trump's actions toward Ukraine.Pence was also at the Warsaw gathering. For the new government of Ukraine, situated between NATO allies and Russia, the security aid Congress had already approved was a lifeline to the West.Williams was among the staffers in the White House Situation Room who listened and took notes during Trump's July 25 call when he asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for 'a favor.' A whistleblower's complaint about that call helped spark the House impeachment investigation.Williams testified that Trump's discussion on the call of specific investigations struck her as 'unusual and inappropriate' and seemed to point to 'other motivations' for holding up the military aid.After the call, Williams told investigators, she put the White House's rough transcript into the into the vice president's daily briefing book.'I just don't know if he read it,' she said.Williams corroborated the testimony of a previous witness, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an NSC aide on the call, who said the White House dropped the word 'Burisma' from the transcript. She said in an addendum to her testimony that Zelenskiy had mentioned the word 'Burisma' in the call.Vindman and Williams at scheduled to testify together during a public impeachment hearing on Tuesday morning.The White House's decision to put the transcript of the July 25 call on a highly classified server has drawn keen interest throughout the probe. But Morrison said the unusual move was unintentional.Morrison said he was concerned if the call got out it would be politically damaging. He talked to White House lawyer John Eisenberg and they agreed that access should be restricted, he testified.But Morrison said Eisenberg later told him that he did not intend for the call summary to be placed on a highly classified server. Eisenberg's staff apparently put it there by mistake, he said.As the transcripts were released, impeachment investigators wrapped up a rare Saturday session interviewing Mark Sandy, a little-known career official at the Office of Management and Budget who was involved in key meetings about the aid package.Sandy's name had barely come up in previous testimony. But it did on one particular date: July 25, the day of Trump's call with Zelenskiy. That day, a legal document with Sandy's signature directed a freeze of the security funds to Ukraine, according to testimony.Throughout Morrison's account, he largely confirmed testimony from current and former officials about what has been described as a shadow diplomacy being run by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, often at odds with U.S. national security interests.A few days after the Warsaw meeting, Sondland was on the phone telling Morrison Sept. 7 he had just gotten off a call with the president.Morrison said Sondland related that Trump assured him there were no strings being attached to the military aid for Ukraine.'The president told him there was no quid pro quo, but President Zelenskiy must announce the opening of the investigations and he should want to do it,' Morrison testified.Morrison had what he called a 'sinking feeling' that the aid may not ultimately be released. About that time, three congressional committees said they were launching inquiries into efforts by Trump and Giuliani to investigate the Bidens.At a Sept. 11 meeting at the White House, Pence and GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio 'convinced the president that the aid should be disbursed immediately,' said Morrison, who said he was briefed about the meeting but did not attend it. 'The case was made to the president that it was the appropriate and prudent thing to do.'___Associated Press writers Matthew Daly and Cal Woodward in Washington and Kathleen Ronayne in Long Beach, California, contributed to this report.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) on Sunday accused the whistleblower who filed a complaint regarding President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine of weakening the United States' relationship with the Eastern European country.The whistleblower,'reportedly a CIA analyst formerly detailed to the White House, has alleged that Trump used military aid as leverage in his efforts to get Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden. His complaint is the subject of the House's ongoing impeachment inquiry into the president.But Johnson, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, blamed the whistleblower <U+2015> not Trump and his alleged pressure campaign <U+2015> for any strain on U.S.-Ukraine relations during an appearance on NBC's 'Meet the Press.''One thing that I want to point out is the damage that's being done to our country through this entire impeachment process,' Johnson said.'You know, it's going to be very difficult for future presidents to have a candid conversation with a world leader because now we've set the precedent of leaking transcripts,' he added.The comment appeared to be a criticism of the whistleblower and his sources, though the White House is the only party that has published a summary, which Trump has incorrectly referred to as a 'transcript,' of his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.'WATCH: @SenRonJohnson says the whistleblower complaint 'exposed things that didn't need to be exposed.' #MTP #IfItsSunday""If the whistleblower's goal is to improve our relationship with Ukraine, he utterly -- or she -- utterly failed."" pic.twitter.com/FBPxpT0BL1'By the way, those individuals that leaked this, if their interest was a stronger relationship with Ukraine, they didn't accomplish it,' Johnson continued. 'Having this all come out into public has weakened that relationship <U+2015> has exposed things that didn't need to be exposed.'Johnson told CNN earlier this month that he, along with several of Trump's advisers, had to persuade the president to release the congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine. Trump eventually did so after the White House was made aware of the whistleblower's complaint.But the Republican senator suggested Sunday that exposing Trump's actions is bad for America and should have been dealt with privately.'This would have been far better off if we had just taken care of this behind the scenes,' Johnson said.

"153",1447452500,"Poll: Americans Divided On Impeachment After 1st Day Of Hearings","Wednesday's widely followed impeachment hearings looking at the actions of President Donald Trump left viewers with negative views of congressional Republicans' behavior, mixed views of the Democrats and tentatively favorable views of the two initial witnesses, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds. But opinions remain deeply divided along entrenched political lines, and overall attitudes about impeachment appear both closely divided and largely unaffected by the first day of public testimony.Roughly three-quarters of Americans say they paid at least some attention to the hearings: about one-third of Americans report having watched at least part of the first day of hearings, with another 39% saying they had seen clips, highlights or news stories. The rest, 28%, say they hadn't heard anything about it.''Those who followed the hearings are close to evenly divided on congressional Democrats' goals during the hearing, with 46% saying the Democrats were mostly playing politics, and 43% that they were making a good-faith attempt to get to the truth. They are more condemnatory of the House GOP, saying 51% to 34% that the Republicans were largely playing politics.The public gives generally positive ratings to the two men who testified Wednesday, diplomat Bill Taylor and deputy assistant secretary of state George Kent, although many had no opinion of the men. Of those who followed the hearings, 40% view Taylor favorably, 25% unfavorably, and 35% aren't sure. For Kent, those numbers are 35% favorable, 23% unfavorable and 42% not sure.While 21% who followed the hearings say the proceedings improved their view of the Trump administration, a similar 24% say it worsened their view, with the remaining 55% unsure or saying their views didn't change at all.''Opinions generally cleaved to by-now-predictable political divides. Just 5% of Trump voters who followed the hearings say the first day of testimony worsened their view of the White House, while just 7% of Hillary Clinton voters who followed the hearings say it improved their views of the administration. The rest of the audience, including those who didn't vote in 2016 and those who voted for third-party candidates, are modestly more likely to say their opinions of the White House were lowered than that they were raised.Americans say, 43% to 30%, that they think Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in order to get that country's president to investigate allegations of corruption against the Biden family, as Taylor testified; the remainder are unsure. Just 17% say withholding aid in that way would be appropriate, with 26% calling it inappropriate but not impeachable, and 39% saying it's grounds for impeachment. The public is close to evenly split on whether most politicians would be willing to ask a foreign government to investigate a political opponent.More than 80% of Clinton voters say that Trump withheld aid in an attempted quid pro quo, and that doing so is impeachable. Trump voters overwhelmingly deny the existence of a quid pro quo, but are split between the 40% who say doing so would have been appropriate, and the 46% who say it would have been inappropriate but not an impeachable offense.'Clinton voters are the only bloc to agree that most politicians would not ask a foreign government to investigate an opponent <U+2015> two-thirds of Trump voters say they would, and non-voters and third-party voters are divided and largely unsure.The survey finds Americans closely divided on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office, with 45% saying he should be and 42% that he should not. Support for Trump's impeachment and removal has remained between 44% and 48% since late September in HuffPost/YouGov polling, and stood at 46% in a previous survey conducted Nov. 5-6.'Another poll, from Reuters and Ipsos, also fielded following the hearings, found that a plurality of people who followed the hearings reported becoming more supportive of impeachment. At the same time, however, the 4-point margin by which Americans supported impeachment was little changed from the 3-point margin in their previous poll.FiveThirtyEight's average of impeachment polls suggests that support for impeachment may have slightly contracted in the runup to the initial hearings.

"154",1447452479,"Pence Aide Tells Lawmakers Trump’s Call Was ‘Unusual And Inappropriate’","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart at the center of Congress' impeachment investigation was 'inappropriate,' an aide to Vice President Mike Pence told lawmakers, according to a transcript released on Saturday.Jennifer Williams, a foreign policy aide to Pence who was listening to the call on July 25, testified that Trump's insistence that Ukraine carry out politically sensitive investigations 'struck me as unusual and inappropriate.'She said the discussion was 'more political in nature' than phone calls with other foreign leaders, and included what she viewed as specific references to the president's 'personal political agenda.'Trump's call is at the heart of the Democratic-led inquiry into whether the Republican president misused U.S. foreign policy to undermine former Vice President Joe Biden, one of his potential opponents in the 2020 election.The House of Representatives on Saturday also released a transcript of an earlier closed-door deposition by Tim Morrison, a former White House aide with the National Security Council focusing on Europe and Russia policy, who was also on the call.Morrison, who resigned a day before his deposition last month, and Williams both expressed concerns about Trump's remarks to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Williams and Morrison are scheduled to testify publicly next week.'I was not comfortable with any idea that President Zelenskiy should allow himself to be involved in our politics,' Morrison told lawmakers. He also said found Zelenskiy's tone in the call with Trump to be 'obsequious.'Morrison declined to say he thought the call was illegal or improper, stressing instead that he thought it would leak, damaging relations with Ukraine. He said he only learned later that the aid to Ukraine was conditioned on the investigations.In the first public hearing last week, acting ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor pointed to Trump's keen interest in getting the eastern European ally to investigate Biden and reiterated his understanding that $391 million in U.S. security aid was withheld from Kiev unless it cooperated.Morrison said he had reviewed Taylor's testimony and did not dispute it on any significant points.House investigators on Saturday also heard closed-door testimony from a White House budget official about the holdup of military aid to Ukraine. Mark Sandy, a career official of the Office of Management and Budget, was the first person from OMB to testify before the inquiry after three political appointees defied congressional subpoenas to appear.Sandy spoke about how unusual it was to have a political appointee come in and place a hold on military aid to Ukraine, CNN quoted a source familiar with the testimony as saying.Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, a member of the Judiciary and Oversight Committees, said Sandy was brought in to shed light on whether military aid was held up for political reasons.'This is a technical part of our investigation,' Raskin told reporters outside the interview room.'We want to know exactly how the president translated his political objective to shake down the Ukrainian government for the favors he wanted (into) the budget process.''On Friday, Trump used Twitter to criticize a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, while she was testifying to an impeachment hearing, an extraordinary moment that Democrats said amounted to witness intimidation.Trump defended his attack on Yovanovitch, saying he had the right to free speech.Yovanovitch, a career diplomat, testified on the second day of televised impeachment hearings, which will resume next week.While Yovanovitch's testimony dominated headlines on Friday, a closed-door deposition later in the day with David Holmes, a U.S. embassy official in Kiev, could prove more consequential.Holmes told lawmakers he overheard a phone call between Trump and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, in which the president inquired about Ukraine's willingness to carry out investigations of Biden and his son.The phone call occurred on July 26, one day after the now-infamous phone conversation between Trump and Zelenskiy.'So, he's gonna do the investigation?' Trump asked Sondland, referring to Zelenskiy, according to Holmes' testimony.'He's gonna do it,' replied Sondland, adding the Ukrainian president would do 'anything you ask him to,' according to Holmes.The testimony by Holmes, an aide to Taylor, ties Trump more directly to a pressure campaign in Ukraine to investigate the Bidens led by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.Holmes' statement appears to contradict Sondland's previous sworn testimony about his interactions with Trump, in which he did not mention his July 26 phone call with the president.Sondland, who has already revised his testimony once, is scheduled to testify publicly on Wednesday.Morrison said he understood that Sondland and Trump had spoken 'half a dozen times' between mid-July and mid-September, adding that he, National Security Adviser John Bolton and other officials viewed Sondland's involvement as 'a problem.'Representative Eric Swalwell, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Saturday that House leaders were considering bringing Holmes in for a public hearing.(Reporting by Jan Wolfe, Nandita Bose, Patricia Zengerle, Brad Heath and Andrea Shalal in Washington; writing by Nick Zieminski and Daniel Wallis; editing by Bill Berkrot, Grant McCool and Himani Sarkar)Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Neither immediately responded..@SteveScalise blew the nasty & obnoxious Chris Wallace (will never be his father, Mike!) away on Chris's lowest rated (unless I'm on) morning show. This kind of dumb and unfair interview would never have happened in the @FoxNews past. Great job Steve!Though Fox News is often a safe space for Trump, featuring largely friendly coverage of his presidency, he has previously lashed out at a few network employees who have at times been critical of his actions.Last month, he tweeted that someone should explain to Wallace that his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the focal point of a subsequent whistleblower complaint and the ongoing impeachment inquiry, was a 'good one.' He repeatedly attacked anchor Shepard Smith, calling him 'hopeless' and 'totally biased' before Smith abruptly left the network last month.Trump's latest criticism of Wallace came hours after the 'Fox News Sunday' host interviewed Scalise. During the exchange, Wallace called out Scalise for 'very badly' mischaracterizing some of the impeachment inquiry witnesses' testimonies.'Ultimately, President Trump and President Zelensky were the ones on the call,' Scalise told Wallace. 'Both of them said there was nothing wrong. The foreign minister of Ukraine just came out a few days ago to clear some of this up to say there was never a link between money <U+2015>'Wallace interrupted to point out that the Ukrainian foreign minister hadn't been on the call.

"160",1447571502,"Pelosi Says Trump Welcome To Testify In Impeachment Inquiry","WASHINGTON (AP) ' Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi invited President Donald Trump to testify in front of investigators in the House impeachment inquiry ahead of a week that will see several key witnesses appear publicly.Pushing back against accusations from the president that the process has been stacked against him, Pelosi said Trump is welcome to appear or answer questions in writing, if he chooses.'If he has information that is exculpatory, that means ex, taking away, culpable, blame, then we look forward to seeing it,' she said in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS's 'Face the Nation.' Trump 'could come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants,' she said.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer echoed that suggestion.'If Donald Trump doesn't agree with what he's hearing, doesn't like what he's hearing, he shouldn't tweet. He should come to the committee and testify under oath. And he should allow all those around him to come to the committee and testify under oath,' Schumer told reporters. He said the White House's insistence on blocking witnesses from cooperating begs the question: 'What is he hiding?'Trump on Monday said he would 'strongly consider' Pelosi's suggestion that he testify.'Even though I did nothing wrong, and don't like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!' the president tweeted.Our Crazy, Do Nothing (where's USMCA, infrastructure, lower drug pricing & much more?) Speaker of the House, Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who is petrified by her Radical Left knowing she will soon be gone (they & Fake News Media are her BOSS), suggested on Sunday's DEFACE THE NATION........that I testify about the phony Impeachment Witch Hunt. She also said I could do it in writing. Even though I did nothing wrong, and don't like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!The comments come as the House Intelligence Committee prepares for a second week of public hearings as part of its inquiry, including with the man who is arguably the most important witness. Gordon Sondland, Trump's ambassador to the European Union, is the only person interviewed to date who had conversations directly with the president because the White House has blocked others from cooperating with what they dismiss as a sham investigation. And testimony suggests he was intimately involved in discussions that are at the heart of the investigation into whether Trump held up U.S. military aid to Ukraine to try to pressure the county's president to announce an investigation into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading 2020 candidate, and his son, Hunter.Multiple witnesses overheard a phone call in which Trump and Sondland reportedly discussed efforts to push for the investigations. In private testimony to impeachment investigators made public Saturday, Tim Morrison, a former National Security Council aide and longtime Republican defense hawk, said Sondland told him he was discussing Ukraine matters directly with Trump.Morrison said Sondland and Trump had spoken approximately five times between July 15 and Sept. 11 ' the weeks that $391 million in U.S. assistance was withheld from Ukraine before it was released.And he recounted that Sondland told a top Ukrainian official in a meeting that the vital U.S. military assistance might be freed up if the country's top prosecutor 'would go to the mike and announce that he was opening the Burisma investigation.' Burisma is the gas company that hired Hunter Biden.Morrison's testimony contradicted much of what Sondland told congressional investigators during his own closed-door deposition, which the ambassador later amended.Trump has said he has no recollection of the overheard call and has suggested he barely knew Sondland, a wealthy donor to his 2016 campaign. But Democrats are hoping he sheds new light on the discussions.'I'm not going to try to prejudge his testimony,' Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., said on 'Fox News Sunday.' But he suggested, 'it was not lost on Ambassador Sondland what happened to the president's close associate Roger Stone for lying to Congress, to Michael Cohen for lying to Congress. My guess is that Ambassador Sondland is going to do his level best to tell the truth, because otherwise he may have a very unpleasant legal future in front of him.'The committee will also be interviewing a long list of others. On Tuesday, they'll hear from Morrison along with Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, Alexander Vindman, the director for European affairs at the National Security Council, and Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine.On Wednesday the committee will hear from Sondland in addition to Laura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary of defense, and David Hale, a State Department official. And on Thursday, Fiona Hill, a former top NSC staffer for Europe and Russia, will appear.Trump, meanwhile, continued to tweet and retweet a steady stream of commentary from supporters as he bashed 'The Crazed, Do Nothing Democrats' for 'turning Impeachment into a routine partisan weapon.''That is very bad for our Country, and not what the Founders had in mind!!!!' he wrote.He also tweeted a doctored video exchange between Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, in which Schiff said he did not know the identity of the whistleblower whose complaint triggered the inquiry. The clip has been altered to show Schiff wearing a referee's uniform and loudly blowing a whistle.In her CBS interview, Pelosi vowed to protect the whistleblower, whom Trump has said should be forced to come forward despite longstanding whistleblower protections.'I will make sure he does not intimidate the whistleblower,' Pelosi said.Trump has been under fire for his treatment of one of the witnesses, the former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, whom Trump criticized by tweet as she was testifying last week.That attack prompted accusations of witness intimidation from Democrats and even some criticism from Republicans, who have been largely united in their defense of Trump'I think, along with most people, I find the president's tweet generally unfortunate,' said Ohio Republican Rep. Mike Turner on CNN's 'State of the Union.'Still, he insisted that tweets were 'certainly not impeachable and it's certainly not criminal. And it's certainly not witness intimidation,' even if Yovanovitch said she felt intimidated by the attacks.Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said Trump 'communicates in ways that sometimes I wouldn't,' but dismissed the significance of the attacks.'If your basis for impeachment is going to include a tweet, that shows how weak the evidence for that impeachment is,' he said on ABC's 'This Week.'And the backlash didn't stop Trump from lashing out at yet another witness, this time Pence aide Williams.

He added: 'I'd say history is closing in on him, facts are closing in' on Trump. But Rather said he doubts the Senate will hold a 'real' impeachment trial.'The cult concept appears to part a growing narrative about the president's pull on the Republican Party and his supporters.

"164",1447855338,"'Case F**king Closed': Stephen King Sums Up Impeachment Evidence Against Trump","Author Stephen King can't understand why anyone is still in doubt about President Donald Trump after the first set of public impeachment hearings last week.Multiple witnesses have testified that Trump withheld aid to Ukraine to pressure the country into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden, and conspiracy theories about a Democratic National Committee computer server.Biden is the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, and is consistently ahead of Trump in early polling, something the president has raged about on Twitter.King tweeted on Sunday:Trump tried to use blackmail and coercion in order to torpedo the candidacy of the man he saw as his chief roadblock to a second term. Case fucking closed.The bestselling author has been a frequent Trump critic on social media and was even blocked by the president for his comments.'I might've said he had his head somewhere where a certain yoga position would be necessary to get it there,' King told Stephen Colbert last year. 'And that was it, man.'Public impeachment hearings resume on Tuesday with four key witnesses, including Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council's Ukraine expert, and Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence who has previously testified that Trump's request of Ukraine was to serve his 'personal political agenda.''",2019-11-18 03:28:55
"165",1447859907,"Avoiding Race 'Wasn't An Option' For 'Watchmen'","HBO's 'Watchmen' made its intentions clear when it started its first episode with a depiction of the 1921 Tulsa Massacre. The superhero series is a new version of the 1986 alt-history graphic novel, and it isn't shy about taking on race.And not everyone's happy about that.The series, created by Damon Lindelof ('Lost,' 'The Leftovers'), has received effusive praise from many fans and critics, though a number of outlets have reported that there's a contingent of people seemingly review bombing the show, unhappy with its politics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the critics' score for the show is in the 90s, while the audience score is in the low 40s.Criticism of the show is understandable, given that it is an unequivocally new take on the source material. With so many mysteries going on, from squid falling out of the sky to whatever is happening with Jeremy Irons' Adrian Veidt, even the most avid consumers of Peteypedia, the show's supplemental material, might be confused. However, with the Cold War being such an integral plot point in the 1986 comics, criticizing 'Watchmen' for being political is like criticizing Silver Lube Man for being lubey.'In an interview with HuffPost, Nicole Kassell, the executive producer and a director of the show, addressed the criticism, explaining why the show is so relevant now and how there was never any question of whether 'Watchmen' would tackle race head on.Nicole, through these first episodes, I've been confused. But I'm OK with it! What reactions were you expecting?I don't know what I was expecting, but that's entirely what I'm receiving. I appreciate you saying you're OK with it. Other people are very frustrated by it, but I just encourage people to hang in there. The answers are coming. I wasn't confused because I was so embedded in the story as a whole; that was not my reaction when I read the script or watched it. But I understand.What was the balance of making this a new story, but also filling in the backstory from the comic?That's the mastery of the writing. I credit Damon and his writing team with that. It was definitely tricky. Damon had the first tier of readers: me and the production team and HBO. So he had these sounding boards that were very good at saying, 'We're confused,' and he had to really tread that line of the level of confusion that people can tolerate, because confusion is kind of mystery also, and mystery is very important and suspense, and it is nine hours. It's not a feature, right? So you need to have people wanting to come back.I think as a director, working with the writer, with Damon and whoever the co-writer of the script was, it was just being really honest about my questions. And we would debate what needed to be a little more clarified here or was it fine to know the answer was coming in Episode 5 or 6 or 9?How do you feel about the reaction right now to it?I'm really, really thrilled. It's been everything we hoped for, for sure. With each week as Sunday approaches, that kind of anticipation and anxiety builds because with every episode, you're making yourself vulnerable to reaction again. So Monday morning, I'm relieved to wake up to the positive feedback. Each episode is its own little artistic unit, and kind of the accumulation of the episodes brings expectations and needs. The stakes are high. But it's been so exciting to have really countless people say, 'I've rewatched the pilot three times now,' or 'I can't wait for the next episode.'Speaking about the reactions, they have seemed overwhelmingly positive, but there is a group of people who attack the show for being too political.'Were you and Damon Lindelof sort of anticipating that?'In terms of anticipating, I'd say there was definitely, for sure, the anxiety of taking on race head on and what the reaction may be to that, but whether or not to do that was not ever a question for me. Whatever I do as a filmmaker, it's very important for me to create something that leaves you with something to talk about and think about. And the fact that this was taking on an issue that is current and alive right now was honestly a relief to me of how I can contribute to the conversation and navigate the storm inside of me that has come up since the election and since Charlottesville.It didn't make it not scary to do, and we talked about it a lot. But the question of whether or not to do it wasn't an option to me. I was thrilled that Damon was taking this on, and that he was using his platform to take it on. He's got a big microphone, and I forget who to attribute the quote to, but it is that thing that if you see something and don't say something, you are contributing to the problem. I felt that it was actually a really important and responsible thing to do.For me, it does seem like the sincere reactions are mainly positive, because 'Watchmen' was always a political story.I have a very close friend who called me the other day who's a 'Watchmen' diehard fan, and he's kind of the toughest audience. So he called to say, 'Are you OK?' Because there are people out there and saying crap or what not, and he said, 'They're just being lazy. They're not doing the reading.' Not to criticize anyone, but what we were seriously protective of ' and again, I really give Damon this credit ' it was always essential to be true to the spirit of the comic. It is an extremely political piece of literature, and Damon's inception for this was like, 'If I'm going to do this, what is the equivalent of the Cold War now?' And it is race in this country. We even had debates. There were times where I felt maybe it was getting too cynical or dark, the material we're doing, and he had to remind me that's the tone and that's the source, and he has to be true to that.You have President Donald Trump tweeting about how the impeachment is a 'lynching.' What's it like when that's happening and then you have a show that's actually showing the horrors of historical terror regarding race?It's pretty eerie. Things were already in the show before the event happened. And I'm thinking ahead, there's an episode coming up that, when the real world event happened last spring, we were all just gobsmacked. I think this happens a lot in storytelling that the zeitgeist is kind of out there in the culture. It's both eerie and then also affirming that we had our finger on the pulse.What made the Tulsa Massacre the starting point for the show?I'm speaking for Damon, to kind of summarize how he decided to take this on. He had been asked by Warner Brothers three times, 'Will you do 'Watchmen'? Will you do it?' And the third time he said yes because he had read Ta-Nehisi Coates' book, 'Between the World and Me,''and also his essay, 'The Case for Reparations,' in The Atlantic. And when he read that, he learned about the Massacre of 1921, and this place called Black Wall Street in Tulsa. He hadn't known about it and I didn't know about it until I read Damon's script.When he realized that if he was going to do 'Watchmen,' that this was the topic that would be the political crisis within the story, that was the inciting incident because it sets up all of the themes. I think, to me, the fact that the story opens with a little boy looking at the screen and saying, 'There will be no mob justice today. Trust in the law.' And then we'll see him exit into a world, not only into 1921 but into 1938. And over and over into a world where he cannot trust in the law. And we live in the country right now, real America, where a huge part of the population cannot trust in the law. And that's at the heart of what Damon wanted to talk about in doing this.'This interview has been edited for clarity.",2019-11-17 23:45:34

"167",1448046856,"Week 2 Preview: Who’s Testifying And When In The Public Impeachment Hearings","After a whirlwind first week of public hearings in the impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump, the House Intelligence Committee is preparing to hear from a whopping nine more witnesses this week.The committee will conduct several televised hearings from Tuesday through Thursday this week. Tuesday and Wednesday will feature two hearings each (one in the morning and one in the afternoon), and Thursday will have one hearing. All of the witnesses called to publicly testify have already spoken to investigators in closed-door depositions.The busy impeachment week comes after the committee heard last week from Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine; George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary for Europe and Eurasian affairs; and Marie Yovanovitch, who was the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine before she was removed from her position earlier this year and replaced with Taylor.House impeachment investigators are looking into whether Trump abused the power of his office and put personal interests above national security. The president is accused of withholding U.S. military aid to Ukraine until the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to publicly commit to investigating Trump's 2020 political rival and former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as his son Hunter Biden. The impeachment inquiry began in September after an unnamed whistleblower from the intelligence community filed a complaint alleging that Trump and his allies tried to extort Ukraine in order to get himself reelected.With the chaos that came from just three public witnesses in one week, this week's nine witnesses are sure to test viewers' stamina in keeping up with the investigation. Here is a brief look ahead of who is testifying this week and when, and what to keep an eye out on in their testimony:''Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman is the director for European affairs at the National Security Council, making him the White House's top Ukraine expert. He's also the first impeachment witness with firsthand knowledge of Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky because he was on the call.The Iraq War veteran and Purple Heart recipient privately testified to lawmakers in October that he twice reported the call to the NSC's lead counsel because he felt it was his duty to share his concerns about the alleged attempted extortion. He also said that the White House's summary of the phone call had key omissions that raise questions about its handling, but do not change the basic contents of the call.Trump tried to dismiss Vindman's testimony by calling him a 'Never Trumper witness,' and many of the president's allies questioned his patriotism accusing him of being a double agent. Several Republicans defended Vindman in the face of such criticism.Vindman's firsthand account is expected to throw off Republicans' current argument that House Democrats are not conducting a credible investigation because every witness called to testify so far has not been a direct witness to wrongdoing by the president.''Jennifer Williams is a top special adviser to Vice President Mike Pence for Europe and Russia affairs, and a career foreign service officer at the State Department. She was also on Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, making Tuesday morning's public impeachment hearing one where lawmakers will hear from two witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the incident.In her Nov. 7 closed-door deposition, Williams testified that Trump's insistence that Ukraine conduct politically sensitive investigations 'struck me as unusual and inappropriate.' She also said she heard Zelensky on the call mention Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company that Hunter Biden used to serve on the board of until earlier this year. The White House's summary of the call did not include Zelensky's mentioning Burisma, which Trump accused Joe Biden of inappropriately favoring while he was vice president.Pence was originally supposed to attend Zelensky's inauguration earlier this year but was ordered to skip it. Williams told lawmakers that she believed that order to have come directly from Trump.On Sunday, Trump lashed out at Williams on Twitter, accusing her of participating in a 'presidential attack' and calling her a 'Never Trumper.' He also insinuated that he does not know who she is, despite being a high-level State Department official working under his vice president.'''Kurt Volker was the State Department's special envoy to Ukraine until he handed in his resignation Sept. 27 in response to his name being mentioned in the whistleblower complaint.'Volker was the first witness called to privately testify in the impeachment investigation, in which he said he was not 'fully in the loop' of Trump's call with Zelensky. But text messages between him, Taylor and U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordan Sondland'that Volker gave to Congress contradict that narrative, as the texts showed clear concern over the president's withholding of military aid to Ukraine.The former State Department official also testified that Ukrainian officials 'asked to be connected' to Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani as a direct backdoor channel to Trump. The whistleblower complaint alleged that Volker set up the meeting between Giuliani and top Zelensky aide Andriy Yermak, and tried to advise Ukrainian officials on how to collaborate with Trump and his personal attorney.Volker also personally told Giuliani that Yuriy Lutsenko, whose conspiracy theories were largely responsible for Yovanovitch's ouster, was 'not credible.'Tim Morrison was one of the top Russia experts for the National Security Council until he resigned Oct. 30, a day before his closed-door deposition with impeachment investigators.The former NSC official testified that he was on Trump's July 25 call and that he didn't find anything 'improper' about the contents of the call. Morrison still contacted then-national security adviser John Bolton and NSC lawyer John Eisenberg out of concern regarding potential leaks to the public. Morrison believed the NSC should have taken action to restrict access to the call transcript to prevent damage to U.S.-Ukraine relations, but testified that he was surprised to learn it was put on a high-level, top-secret server.Morrison said he got a 'sinking feeling' after he was told by Gordon Sondland that the EU ambassador had informed Ukrainian officials that a White House meeting and military aid were contingent on Zelensky publicly committing to an investigation into the Bidens.'He also said Sondland told him he was acting on Trump's direct orders.Morrison also said he first alerted Taylor to concerns over the call by telling him Trump did not want to provide any security assistance at all to Ukraine.'Gordon Sondland is a Republican donor-turned-U.S. ambassador to the European Union who quickly became one of the most important key players in the impeachment investigation after several other witnesses cited his involvement in Trump's backchannel to Ukraine relations.Sondland initially testified in his closed-door deposition that he didn't recall having any discussions about the Bidens, or taking part in encouraging an investigation into them. But after Taylor and Vindman contradicted Sondland's testimony, he significantly amended his narrative Nov. 5 to say he told Zelensky's aide Yermak that military funding was contingent on Ukraine publicly announcing an investigation into the Bidens, and that he knew it was illegal.Taylor testified last week that an aide of his met with Sondland in Ukraine on July 26 when the ambassador took a phone call from Trump. That aide, later discovered to be David Holmes, alleges he heard Trump asking if Ukraine agreed to conduct the investigations he wanted, to which Sondland said Zelensky is 'gonna do it.''The Associated Press later learned that a second U.S. Embassy staff member in Ukraine overheard Sondland's call: Suriya Jayanti, a foreign service officer based in Kyiv.The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that emails reviewed by the newspaper showed Sondland kept several Trump officials <U+2015> like acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Energy Secretary Rick Perry <U+2015> informed of his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.Laura Cooper is the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia. Since the summer, Cooper pressured the Pentagon to get the military aid to Ukraine released and argued that withholding it was not in the U.S.'s national security interests.The Pentagon also reportedly told the White House that the agency would not be able to spend all the military aid by Sept. 30 <U+2015> the end of the fiscal year <U+2015> if it was not released by Aug. 6, putting the Defense Department at risk of violating the Impoundment Control Act. It was reported Sept. 12 that the freeze on the aid was lifted.In her closed-door deposition, Cooper said Volker led her to make a 'very strong inference' that Ukrainian officials knew the U.S. was withholding military aid long before that was public information, and that Ukrainian leaders would not have committed to making a public statement on investigations unless they were doing so in exchange for 'something valuable.''There were two specific things that the Government of Ukraine wanted during this time frame,' Cooper told lawmakers. 'One was ... a hosted visit at the White House. And the other was Ukraine security assistance.'David Hale is the undersecretary of state for political affairs, making him the third-ranking official at the State Department.In Hale's closed-door deposition, the senior official told lawmakers that the State Department believed that publicly defending Yovanovitch when she was being disparaged and eventually recalled as ambassador to Ukraine would have hurt efforts to lift the freeze on nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. He also said that senior officials were concerned about Giuliani's potential reaction to the State Department coming to Yovanovitch's defense amid Trump's smearing of the career diplomat.Yovanovitch publicly testified about how Trump, Giuliani and conservative media launched a smear campaign on her reputation as a U.S. diplomat. She stressed that her ouster 'had a chilling effect' on current department officials because it showed how diplomats and U.S. policy are vulnerable to foreign and private influence, and that the State Department 'is being hollowed out from within at a competitive and complex time on the world stage.'The former ambassador previously testified that when she went to senior State Department officials to seek a reaffirming public statement of support in response to the smear campaign, the department told her there was 'caution about any kind of statement, because it could be undermined' by a Trump tweet.Fiona Hill was the former top policy adviser on Russia for the National Security Council for about two years until she resigned in July. She was reportedly told as early as May that there was a pressure campaign by Sondland and Giuliani on Ukraine's government, according to NBC News.The former NSC official told lawmakers in her closed-door deposition that she considered Sondland to be a national security risk because of his inexperience as the Trump-appointed EU ambassador. She also said that Sondland had talked in front of her about how he had an agreement with Mulvaney for a meeting with Ukrainian officials.Hill testified that Sondland had told her he was 'in charge of Ukraine.' When she asked him who authorized such a change, she said Sondland told her: 'the president.'After learning about Sondland and Giuliani's shadow diplomacy, Hill reportedly briefed Bolton, her boss at the time. Bolton later described what Hill told him as a kind of 'drug deal.''Both Hill and Bolton were reportedly so alarmed by the shadow diplomacy that she alerted White House lawyers.Holmes is the political counsel at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine and an aide to Taylor. He got roped into the impeachment investigation after Taylor mentioned at his public hearing that his aide overheard Sondland on the phone with Trump saying Zelensky will cooperate in investigating the Bidens. That aide was later discovered to be Holmes.The career diplomat gave a closed-door deposition on Friday, where he reportedly confirmed he overheard a phone call between Sondland and Trump on July 26 <U+2015> the day after the president's now-infamous call with Zelensky. Holmes said he was at a restaurant with Sondland in Kyiv during the call when he could hear Trump asking Sondland if the Ukrainian president would conduct an investigation into the Bidens, to which Sondland said that Zelensky would do 'anything you ask him to.'After the call <U+2015> which Holmes said others at the restaurant could probably hear because Sondland held the phone away from his ear due to Trump talking loudly <U+2015> the EU ambassador told Holmes that Trump does not 'give a shit about Ukraine,''according to the aide's deposition. When Holmes reportedly stressed the importance of the U.S. relationship with Ukraine, Sondland clarified he meant issues that personally benefit the president, like the 'Biden investigation.'Holmes's private testimony appeared to contradict Sondland's narrative about his interactions with the president, as the EU ambassador never mentioned the July 26 phone call in his sworn deposition.The aide's public testimony will increase the significance of Thursday's hearing as House Democrats consider Holmes a witness with firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing.'This article has been updated with information about David Holmes' expected testimony and with details from Tim Morrison's testimony.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"168",1448451665,"State Department Official Resigns After Allegedly Inflating Resume","A high-level State Department staffer has resigned after facing allegations that she embellished her resume, Politico reported'on Monday.Mina Chang, who served as the deputy assistant secretary in the State Department's Bureau of Conflict and Stability Operations, came under scrutiny last week after NBC News reported'that she had misrepresented her academic credentials and created a fake Time magazine cover with her face on it.'Resigning is the only acceptable moral and ethical option for me at this time,' Chang wrote in her resignation letter, obtained by Politico.She continued: 'In already difficult times, the Department of State is experiencing what I and many believe is the worst and most profound moral crisis confronting career professionals and political appointees in the Department's history. Department morale is at its lowest, the professionalism and collegiality <U+2015> once a hallmark of the U.S. diplomatic service <U+2015> has all but disappeared.'Chang, who joined the State Department in April, appeared to be taking aim at the department's leaders, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who have been criticized for not doing enough to protect career diplomats amid the House impeachment investigation.In her letter, Chang also accused her superiors at the department of failing to defend her in the face of the NBC report.'A character assassination based solely on innuendo was launched against me attacking my credentials and character,' she wrote. 'My superiors at the Department refused to defend me, stand up for the truth or allow me to answer the false charges against me.'The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.According to NBC, Chang identified herself as an 'alumna' of Harvard Business School in her official biography. But she only attended a seven-week course at the institution in 2016 and did not earn a degree from the university.A spokesperson for Harvard Business School told NBC that the school grants 'alumni status' to those who have attended certain executive education programs, even if they did not earn a degree there.Chang also claimed to have addressed both the Democratic and Republican national conventions in 2016, when in fact she spoke at separate events not sponsored by the conventions.The fake Time magazine cover appeared during a 2017 interview with a YouTube host on the topic of countering violent extremism. Chang was then the chief executive of a nonprofit called Linking the World.'Here you are on Time magazine, congratulations! Tell me about this cover and how it came to be?' the interviewer asked.'Well, we started using drone technology in disaster response and so that was when the whole talk of how is technology being used to save lives in disaster response scenarios <U+2015> I suppose I brought some attention to that,' Chang said.The interviewer told NBC that Chang brought the cover to the interview among a number of photos that were shown during their discussion.Chang has denied the NBC report, saying she did not misrepresent her credentials and claiming someone else created the Time cover without her knowledge.Chang had been nominated for a position at the U.S. Agency for International Development, where she would have overseen a budget of more than $1 billion. Her nomination was withdrawn in early September without public explanation. According to NBC, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations had asked her for more documents and details regarding her work experience.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Holmes said Trump was talking so loudly that Sondland had to hold the phone from his ear.This conversation came a day after Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump pressed his counterpart to investigate 2020 presidential rival Joe Biden. A whistleblower's complaint about that call sparked the announcement of the impeachment inquiry.After Sondland told Trump on the July 26 call that Zelensky 'loves your ass,' the U.S. president responded, 'So, he's going to do the investigation?''He's going to do it,' Sondland replied.Hale, who spoke to lawmakers earlier this month, testified that State Department records show Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, twice in late March. These calls came around the time that Giuliani was involved in'a political smear campaign against former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.Yovanovitch, who testified Friday, said that she tried to get Pompeo to issue a statement of support for her but learned that he declined to do so, purportedly out of concern that Trump could undermine it in a tweet.Hale also said that Pompeo called Fox News host Sean Hannity, which Hannity has denied.'Read David Holmes's testimony here,'and David Hale's testimony here.Holmes overheard a July 26 call between Trump and Sondland, in which Trump asked if Zelensky committed to 'do the investigation.'Sondland then told Holmes Trump didn't care about Ukraine, only his personal interests.Read his and David Hale's testimony:https://t.co/kIN698MiFCHere you can read the transcript of Hale's testimony:Below you can read the transcript of Holmes' testimony.In his testimony, Holmes also detailed how Giuliani was promoting a political agenda, including an investigation of former Vice President Biden and his son Hunter and of supposed Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election (a debunked conspiracy theory that Giuliani nevertheless still pushed).'The themes that Mr. Giuliani was promoting and his associates were promoting....

"176",1448958943,"Trump Donor Gordon Sondland’s Testimony Could Be An Impeachment Turning Point","In seeking to deny the existence of a quid pro quo that's become the center of an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump is relying on the testimony of Gordon Sondland, a hotel magnate who secured his position as ambassador after giving $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee.Sondland is set to publicly testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday in what has the potential to be the most consequential day of the impeachment saga thus far. Sondland, other officials have testified, was a key figure in the apparent plot to condition the release of U.S. military aid on the Ukrainians announcing an investigation into 2020 political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.'The first week of hearings in the impeachment inquiry largely featured testimony from cooperative witnesses. As the White House blocked certain primary witnesses from testifying, Republicans complained that the witnesses who did appear lacked firsthand knowledge of the alleged scheme.Sondland does have firsthand knowledge of key facts, and his testimony could be combative. The self-described lifelong Republican already had to correct the record following closed-door testimony on Oct. 17, and several other government officials have offered accounts that contrast with Sondland's.'Sondland, whom Trump named U.S. ambassador to the European Union, took on a major role in Ukrainian policy. He was in communication with Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who was working with two indicted Ukrainian Americans who sought the ouster of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.Sondland, in his testimony last month, sought to portray himself as disappointed by Giuliani's involvement in foreign relations.'Sondland told lawmakers that Trump was 'skeptical that Ukraine was serious about reforms and anti-corruption' and that it was 'apparent' that Giuliani was 'the key to changing the President's mind on Ukraine.''He claimed he was 'disappointed' by Trump's instructions to involve Giuliani but that he 'did not understand until much later that Mr. Giuliani's agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate [former] Vice President Biden or his son, or to involve Ukrainians directly or indirectly in the President's 2020 reelection campaign.'Sondland, who said he believed he spoke to Trump five or six times since becoming ambassador, claimed he had 'no idea' that Trump had brought up the Bidens in the call until the White House released a summary of Trump's July 25 conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.But testimony from other officials raised doubts about Sondland's story.'One key scene took place at a restaurant in Kyiv over the summer, when Sondland called up the president after Trump's call with Zelensky.''So, he's going to do the investigation?' Trump asked, according to testimony from State Department official David Holmes, who will testify publicly on Thursday. 'He's going to do it,' Sondland told Trump, according to Holmes. After the Sondland-Trump calls, Holmes said Sondland agreed that Trump didn't 'give a shit about Ukraine' and cared only about the 'big stuff.''Holmes said he'd 'never seen anything like' what he witnessed: someone calling the president from a cellphone in a restaurant in a foreign country and having such a candid conversation.'Holmes said he was surprised that the sensitive conversation took place on a non-secure cellphone call in the middle of a restaurant. 'We generally assume that mobile communications in Ukraine are being monitored.'The Wall Street Journal'reported'that Sondland kept White House officials informed of his activities, and Sondland emailed acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Energy Secretary Rick Perry ahead of a call between Zelensky and Trump and said the Ukrainian president would assure Trump 'that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will 'turn over every stone.''For Democrats, Sondland is a compelling antagonist in the impeachment drama. They can portray him as an unqualified political appointee who had no diplomatic experience before he essentially bought a key position in the Trump administration and acted as Trump's yes man as he tried to use U.S. military aid for political gain.CORRECTION: This article previously misstated that Sondland's phone call to the president from the restaurant took place prior to Trump's call to Zelensky.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

'Don't tweet during it, don't get outraged over it.'Instead, Trump should allow his allies to 'fight it out and keep it on the straight and narrow from the Republican perspective,' Kilmeade urged.The Fox News morning program is known to be a favorite of the president, who has routinely live-tweeted what he watches and has offered glowing praise of the show's ratings.

He said Zelensky should announce investigations into a disproven conspiracy theory that Ukraine was involved in hacking the Democratic National Committee and into former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 Trump opponent.'My impression was, in order to get the White House meeting, President Zelensky would have to agree to open these investigations,' Vindman, who listened in on the July 25 call, said.After the call concluded, 'without hesitation, I knew I had to report this to the White House counsel,' Vindman said.'It was improper for the president to demand an investigation into a political opponent, especially a foreign power where there's at best dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation, and that this would have significant implications if this became public knowledge ... it would undermine our Ukraine policy and it would undermine our national security,' Vindman said.At the time, Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials were not aware that U.S. military aid had been frozen on Trump's order and would be used as pressure to force Zelensky to announce these investigations. The Ukrainians would learn about this in early August, according to The New York Times.Zelensky and his advisers believed they needed to announce these investigations to obtain the White House meeting and the release of the military aid. He planned on announcing the investigations in an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria in September.'The reporting of the whistleblower complaint about Trump's efforts to extort him to the House Intelligence Committee on Sept. 9, however, interrupted the whole plan.

"181",1449147999,"What To Watch On Day 3 Of Public Trump Impeachment Hearings","WASHINGTON (AP) ' They heard the July 25 phone call for themselves.And now, Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and adviser Jennifer Williams are set to tell Americans and the world about its content and their concerns as the lead witnesses in perhaps the most consequential week of the impeachment hearings against President Donald Trump.They are the first two of nine witnesses called to testify before the House Intelligence Committee this week. The procession includes officials closest to Trump as lawmakers grind through their investigation of the 45th president.Vindman and Williams were listening with others in the White House Situation Room and heard Trump pressure Ukraine's president to do him the 'favor' of investigating Joe Biden and his son, all while the U.S. had placed a hold on aid to Ukraine.What to watch as the marathon week of hearings opens at 9 a.m. EST Tuesday:___Vindman is a Soviet-era immigrant who came to the U.S. as a toddler and grew up to become a decorated soldier and a White House aide. Now, he is a 20-year Army officer assigned to the National Security Council at the white-hot center of the inquiry.Vindman, 44, testified last month in closed session that he twice raised concerns about Trump and his European Union ambassador, Gordon Sondland, inappropriately pushing Ukrainian leaders to investigate the former vice president and his son.'I have a deep appreciation for American values and ideals and the power of freedom. I am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country, irrespective of party or politics,' Vindman said in written remarks.He earned the Purple Heart after being wounded in Iraq in 2004 leading infantrymen.In October, Vindman attended his closed-door testimony wearing his Army service uniform, with a chest full of military ribbons and other commendations. The visual underscored Trump's conflict with the military and national security establishment.Republicans are expressing concern about Vindman's 'judgment' in handling his concern about the call.___Trump and the world are about to find out. Williams is Vice President Mike Pence's special adviser for Europe and Russia, on detail from the State Department.On July 25, she was in the Situation Room taking notes as Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy about potential 2020 rival Joe Biden's son Hunter, who sat on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company.'It was President Trump who raised Burisma,' Williams testified on Nov. 7. Later, she says that 'I believed those references to be more political in nature and so that struck me as unusual.'The word Burisma does not appear in the rough transcript of the call released by the White House.'Tell Jennifer Williams, whoever that is, to read BOTH transcripts of the presidential calls,' Trump tweeted in part over the weekend. He called her a 'Never Trumper.'___The president and his allies have pointed to Zelenskiy's statement during a September press conference, shoulder-to-shoulder with Trump, in which the Ukrainian president said he didn't feel any pressure in the July 25 call.But even before that call, Zelenskiy had reported feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate Biden, The Associated Press reported.Zelenskiy was concerned Trump and associates were pressing him to take action that could affect the 2020 election, two individuals said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic and political sensitivity of the issue.State Department officials in Kyiv and Washington were briefed on Zelenskiy's concerns at least three times, the two individuals said, and notes summarizing his worries were circulated within the department.___He did last week, castigating the ambassador he fired, Marie Yovanovich, on Twitter and giving weight to her account of being bullied out of her job by members of the administration.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi several times over the past few days has suggested that if Trump wants to testify ' she mockingly explained the word 'exculpatory' ' he's welcome to do so in person or in writing.He hasn't said he will do so. But Trump did tweet: 'Even though I did nothing wrong, and don't like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!'___The administration is confident about the testimony of all the impeachment witnesses this week except for that of EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland on Wednesday, according to two White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking.Like all the witnesses, Sondland will testify under oath and penalty of perjury. Sondland already has had to amend his earlier account after contradicting testimony from others.The White House is happy with the role of Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, as the committee's Republican bulldog questioner. But privately these officials pointed to concerns in the White House about the performance of GOP counsel Steve Castor.___The president's allies have mostly stayed together so far during the hearings, but they are hopping between strategies for pushing back.One argument against the inquiry is that witnesses, including the whistleblower and charge d'affaires William Taylor last week, are reporting the goings-on second- or third-hand. Look for whether they abandon that argument when Vindman and Williams testify.Republicans now say the president is innocent because the military money was eventually released. In fact, it was released Sept. 11 after Congress began looking into the holdup.___Testifying in a second session Tuesday are Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, a former National Security Council aide who oversaw Europe and Russia Policy.___Associated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed to this report.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Alexander Vindman during Tuesday morning's impeachment hearing to gather information about the whistleblower <U+2015> but was quickly shut down by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.Republicans defending President Donald Trump have attempted to create suspicion around the whistleblower report about a July 25 phone call between the U.S. president and his Ukrainian counterpart that kicked off the inquiry.Beginning his line of questioning, Nunes asked Vindman whether he had spoken about the phone call to anyone 'outside the White House.'Vindman said that he had because it is part of his job. He provided a readout of the call to two 'cleared U.S. government officials with the appropriate need to know' about Trump's conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, he testified. One of them was a State Department official, and the other was 'the individual in the intelligence community' thought to be the whistleblower.'Nunes seized on the opportunity to press Vindman for more details about the whistleblower, demanding to know the specific agency to which he or she belongs before Schiff intervened.''Please stop,' Schiff said. 'I want to make sure that there is no effort to out the whistleblower through these proceedings.'Vindman then clarified that he did not know the identity of the whistleblower, merely that the individual had the security clearance necessary to receive information about the call.His response appeared to perplex Nunes, who told the witness he could 'either answer the question or you can plead the Fifth.'At that point, Vindman's counsel stepped in, telling Nunes that 'we're following the rule of the committee, the rule of the chair with regard to this issue.''This does not call for an answer that is invoking the Fifth or anything like that,' the counselor told the ranking member.Schiff later intervened again during questions from Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) about the whistleblower's identity.''You have said ' even though no one believes you, you have said you don't know who the whistleblower is,' Jordan retorted to Schiff. 'So how is this outing the whistleblower?'As the impeachment inquiry has marched on, the whistleblower's legal team has said they'have received numerous death threats.'But Republicans have continued to push for the whistleblower's unmasking <U+2015> even after current and former government officials have corroborated details of the report during public and private hearings, including several firsthand accounts.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

At the heart of House Democrats' inquiry is Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump pressed for a corruption investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, based on unfounded corruption accusations.At the time of their discussion, American military aid to Ukraine was being temporarily withheld, raising serious questions over whether a quid pro quo was being made.On Tuesday morning, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council's leading Ukraine expert, testified before the House Intelligence Committee with firsthand knowledge of the now-infamous call.

(Current government funding runs out on Nov. 21.)Lawmakers struck an odd tone Tuesday. They bemoaned that this continuing resolution was confirmation that 'Congress is not getting its work done,' in the words of Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), because this temporary extension represented failure on a larger deal.'Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said passing this bill was a 'recognition of failure.'But many lawmakers also celebrated the bipartisan bill and its extraneous riders.''This legislation avoids controversial policies and instead contains provisions that reflect shared priorities,' Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) said.Contrary to the usual calls for a 'clean' continuing resolution, this bill was loaded with new provisions and extensions.The most controversial extension was one for expiring portions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The bill would reauthorize three provisions in FISA until March, effectively decoupling government funding from the FISA debate.Of particular note are the broad authorities to wiretap terrorism suspects. The so-called 'Section 206' provisions allow the government to conduct 'roving' wiretaps so that they can thwart suspects who are, for example, switching cell phones. The bill would also reauthorize the ability of the FBI to examine the business records of terrorism suspects, as well as a 'lone wolf' provision that gives the FBI greater authority to go after terrorist suspects who are not connected to any country or group.'Yesterday, Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi said the president has 'abused his power for his own personal, political benefit,'' Amash tweeted Tuesday. 'Today, she wants to extend the president's power to do warrantless surveillance of Americans.'Concerns over reauthorizing those FISA sections was enough for Amash to vote no, as well as some progressives.'When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) saw the inclusion of those provisions, she summoned the words of former 'American Idol' judge Randy Jackson:'Yeah that's gonna be a no from me dog https://t.co/O6t8h6zkgsWow. House Democrats are ignoring civil liberties & including a three month straight re-authorization of the PATRIOT Act (with zero reform) in the Continuing Resolution.Very cool way to resist Trump by ensuring he continues to have terrifying authoritarian surveillance powers. pic.twitter.com/KxiCBlPpKSAside from the FISA provisions, the bill also includes a number of other reauthorizations and changes. It would reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. It would give the Census Bureau money <U+2015> at an annualized rate of $7.3 billion' <U+2015> to prepare for the 2020 Census. It would extend a number of health care programs, including funding for community health centers, which many Republicans oppose over concerns of family planning. It would also block the government from taking back $7.6 billion from states in highway funding, which Republicans also oppose.'As a carrot for Republicans and Democrats, the bill lays the groundwork for a 3.1% pay raise for the military next year. It would also allow people who have received money from a Sept. 11 compensation fund to also apply for money from a state-sponsored compensation fund for terrorism victims. And, as is customary in Congress, it would include a year's salary <U+2015> $174,000 <U+2015> for former Rep. Elijah Cummings's widow, Maya Cummings, who is running to replace the longtime Baltimore lawmaker who died in October.Still, the overwhelming majority of Republicans voted against the continuing resolution, even though failure to pass the short-term bill would result in a shutdown. The ranking Republicans on the Appropriations Committee, Kay Granger of Texas, said Congress had a responsibility to get a long-term deal done, which was why she was voting no.But Democrats said their responsibility was to keep the government funded.Rules Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) mentioned a number of extensions he liked, while also noting the inclusion of some he didn't like, such as the FISA provisions. But, he said, shutdowns cost the government and the American people billions of dollars.'The choice before us today is whether we are going to vote to cause a repeat of that devastation, or not,' McGovern said.The one-month funding extension became necessary to avert a government shutdown because Senate appropriators have still not reached agreement over a full omnibus bill. The biggest hurdle remains Trump's proposed border wall. Democrats want to give Trump as little as possible for the wall, while Republicans and the president himself want billions to build a wall as quickly as possible.Republicans and Democrats agreed to overall spending numbers in July <U+2015> $738 billion for defense and $632 billion for non-defense programs <U+2015> but they've been deadlocked on how to divvy up those numbers among the various programs.With another month, lawmakers hope they can work out a deal to avoid a shutdown that would, perhaps more importantly to the lawmakers, keep them in D.C. over the holidays.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"188",1449305468,"Tuesday’s First Impeachment Hearing Builds The Case For A Quid Pro Quo","WASHINGTON <U+2015> Officials who heard President Donald Trump's interactions with Ukraine over the spring and summer understood that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would have to investigate Trump's political opponents if he hoped to get the White House visit and military aid his country desperately needed, two key witnesses made clear to Congress on Tuesday.'The testimony added more evidence that Trump's request amounted to a quid pro quo.Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a decorated Iraq war veteran who was working in the White House as the National Security Council's Ukraine expert, testified that he saw Trump's push for investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter as an 'order' to Zelensky and felt compelled to report it up the chain of command. Vindman is registered to vote with no party affiliation. Asked if he was a 'Never Trumper,' he called himself a 'never partisan.'State Department official Jennifer Williams said she found Trump's now-infamous July 25 phone call to Zelensky 'unusual' because it involved discussion of a domestic political matter. Williams, who Trump attacked in a tweet as a 'Never Trumper,' serves as an adviser on Russia to Vice President Mike Pence and campaigned for ex-President George W. Bush in 2004. She testified that 'the reference to Biden' on Trump's call with Zelensky 'sounded political.'Republicans on the committee spent most of the hearing attacking the media as Democratic 'puppets' and trying to gently undermine a Purple Heart recipient and a Bush campaign official. Republicans pressed Vindman about being offered the position of defense secretary of Ukraine, which Vindman reported to his superiors when he returned home.'Vindman said the offer wasn't something he seriously considered, and considered it laughable because he's an American and a member of the U.S. military. Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) said the line of questioning was a question about his loyalty 'cloaked in a Brooks Brothers suit.'Vindman testified that he felt it was 'improper for the president to request, to demand, an investigation into a political opponent' and felt he 'had to report this to the White House counsel.' He said it would undermine foreign policy and national security.Vindman testified that Trump didn't mention corruption in either phone call that he had with Zelensky before the July phone call, despite the fact that rooting out corruption in Ukraine was part of U.S. policy and was mentioned in Trump's talking points.'Tuesday's morning session kicked off a busy week in the impeachment process. Ambassador Kurt Volker and Tim Morrison will testify Tuesday afternoon. Trump donor and Ambassador Gordon Sondland, Defense Department official Laura Cooper and U.S. diplomat David Hale will testify Wednesday, and presidential adviser Fiona Hill and State Department official David Holmes will testify on Thursday.'Sondland's highly anticipated testimony could be the most important day of testimony. But Volker is also expected to face tough questions from Democrats, as his testimony has been inconsistent with that of other witnesses. Volker claimed he wasn't aware of being part of an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate Biden, but several other officials testified that Volker was closely involved in the efforts.

Col. Alexander Vindman early in the hearing, an oversight he corrected. Vindman,'the National Security Council's Ukraine expert, was testifying as a witness to Trump's now-infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.""Ranking member, it's lieutenant colonel Vindman, please"" pic.twitter.com/5aKJxC2XORLater, Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah) tried to downplay Nunes' oversight, then <U+2015> under the guise of damage control <U+2015> belittled Vindman's dress uniform.'I see you're wearing your dress uniform, knowing that's not the uniform of the day,' said Stewart. 'You wear a suit to the White House.'He then backtracked slightly and,'proudly pointing to his father's Air Force wings, cast Vindman's attire as 'a great reminder of his military service,' before again attacking Vindman <U+2015> this time for his rank.'I'm curious, when the ranking member referred to you as Mr. Vindman, you quickly corrected him and wanted to be called Lt. Col. Vindman,' he said. 'Do you always insist on civilians calling you by your rank?'As the lieutenant colonel explained why thought it was appropriate to wear his dress uniform, Stewart interrupted him.'When Vindman continued, saying he'd been attacked and marginalized as a military officer in the press and on Twitter, the congressman interrupted him again.After the hearing, Stewart told HuffPost he hadn't meant to imply that Vindman shouldn't have worn his uniform.'How could you interpret that way? I was saying it's a great reminder of his service,' Stewart said. 'I don't know how you could interpret it any other way.'Another member of the Intelligence Committee, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), said it was appropriate for Vindman to wear his uniform but also that he did it for effect.'He's an active duty member of the military and certainly there's nothing wrong with him wearing the uniform,' Conaway said. 'I think he was doing it for effect. He doesn't wear it daily at the White House. But he's clearly earned the right to wear it.'President Trump also repeated the attack in a mid-hearing statement to the media, giving the appearance of a concerted Republican push:Trump also said the Republican members are ""killing it"" during the impeachment hearings. pic.twitter.com/CcVL4ARAbb'I don't know, as he says, 'lieutenant colonel' <U+2015> I understand someone had the misfortune of someone calling him 'Mr.' and he corrected them,' Trump said, seeking to distance himself from the testimony.'I never saw the man,' he continued. 'I understand now he wears his uniform when he goes in. I don't know Vindman at all.'Vindman is a Harvard-educated officer who served multiple overseas tours in South Korea, Germany and Iraq, where he was injured by a roadside bomb, for which he received a Purple Heart. He emphasized that military service in his opening statement.'For more than two decades, it has been my honor to serve as an officer in the United States Army,' he said Tuesday morning. 'As an infantry officer, I served multiple overseas tours, including South Korea and Germany, and I was deployed to Iraq for combat operations.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"190",1449411362,"Republicans Will Never Be Convinced Trump Did Something Wrong","WASHINGTON <U+2015> As Democrats continue to lay out their case for impeaching President Donald Trump, one thing is becoming increasingly clear: There is nothing Republican lawmakers could hear that would change their minds.'It's all bullshit,' Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) told HuffPost on Tuesday.'King said he hasn't seen anything in the House Intelligence Committee's hearings that has made him uncomfortable. 'There's nothing there,' he said. 'There's absolutely nothing there.'Asked if there were any evidence that would make him uncomfortable, King said he wouldn't get into hypotheticals. 'The whole thing is a fraud, just like the Russia thing,' he said.Republicans complained on Tuesday that Democrats were using all the wrong words. They argued that Trump was asking for a favor <U+2015> a legitimate one, in their minds <U+2015> not 'demanding' that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky open an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. They argued that administration officials have merely been interpreting Trump's motivations while the president himself (shockingly) has not admitted to seeking a quid pro quo. They even suggested that a key impeachment witness might be wearing the wrong clothes.'During Tuesday morning's hearing, Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah) noted that Alexander Vindman was wearing his military uniform, even though he generally wears a suit to the White House. Vindman had corrected Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) for referring to him as 'Mister' instead of by his rank <U+2015> 'Lieutenant Colonel' <U+2015> so Stewart asked if he always insisted that civilians call him by his rank. Vindman said people in the press and on Twitter had 'marginalized' him as a military officer.After the hearing, Stewart said he did not mean to imply that Vindman should not have worn his military uniform.''I was saying it's a great reminder of his service,' Stewart said. 'I don't know how you could interpret it any other way.''Republicans appear convinced that Trump did nothing wrong, and no matter what comes out in the Intelligence Committee, no matter who testifies, it seems the overwhelming majority of Republicans in Congress are never going to accept that the president acted improperly.'It's perfectly within the purview of the president's authority,' Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) told HuffPost.Perry said it was 'totally appropriate' for Trump to safeguard American taxpayers by withholding military security aid for Ukraine, and he dismissed those testifying that there was a connection between the withholding of the aid and the possibility of Zelensky announcing an investigation because 'they're not the president.'Asked if there was anything Congress could find out that would make him uncomfortable, Perry said if Zelensky were trying to bribe Trump or Trump were trying to bribe Zelensky, then he'd be uncomfortable. 'But I haven't seen any of that,' Perry said.Republicans are increasingly clinging to the talking point that all these White House aides and State Department officials were operating with a false understanding of the president's intentions. To the GOP lawmakers, because there's no evidence that Trump ever directly said there was a connection between the security aid and an investigation into the Bidens, there could not have been a connection.'If you read the actual transcript of the call, to me there's nothing impeachable there,' Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) told HuffPost.In the rough transcript of their July 25 call released by the White House, Trump asked Zelensky to 'do us a favor' and investigate possible Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He also raised the topic of investigating Joe and Hunter Biden. But Lesko said that because Trump did not mention either Biden immediately after the word 'favor,' he wasn't asking for an investigation into the Bidens.''Biden was not in that same paragraph,' Lesko said.Multiple U.S. officials who worked on supplying nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine have testified that it was their understanding the aid would not be released until Zelensky announced such an investigation. Democrats say the aid was only released without that promise because the whistleblower came forward and shined a light on the president's scheme.But Republicans have jumped to the opposite conclusion: that the aid was released because Trump's intentions were pure. And no amount of testimony to the contrary looks likely to change their minds.'Democrats are striking out here,' Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) said. 'Not a single witness has stated that any crime has been committed. Certainly no impeachable crimes.''Brady also mocked Democrats for shifting from alleging a quid pro quo to alleging bribery. 'Maybe it's bribery with puppies and sprinkles on top,' he said.'Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) insisted that because the witnesses didn't directly hear from the president that the push for a Biden investigation was politically motivated or that it was tied to the aid, that means it wasn't. He said the case for impeachment was built on 'an interpretation of a phone call by somebody that never met the president, never talked to the president.'Testimony from Gordon Sondland, a major Trump campaign donor whom the president named U.S. ambassador to the European Union, might be more enlightening, the congressman said.''Let's talk about people that have real knowledge of why the aid was withheld, and we'll get some of that tomorrow,' Meadows said on Tuesday. 'Ambassador Sondland will certainly be able to speak to that more directly than any witness today.'Sondland has already amended his testimony once to note that he now remembers having a conversation with a Ukrainian official in which he made it clear that a White House meeting with Zelensky and the security aid were contingent on Ukraine opening an inquiry into Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden sat.Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor testified last week that one of his aides overheard a conversation between Trump and Sondland in which the president asked about 'the investigations.' If that is true, Sondland's already shaky testimony will look even more unreliable.'Sondland initially testified behind closed doors that he did not believe there was a quid pro quo, and Republicans are counting on him to reiterate that belief on Wednesday, even though his amended testimony now makes it clear he did believe there was a quid pro quo.Still, even if Sondland ends up supporting the conclusions that Democrats are drawing, Republicans are unlikely to be convinced.'What I would say is, there are conversations and things that have been held that may not always follow best practices,' Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.) told HuffPost on Tuesday. 'But to jump to the point where it's treasonous or high crimes, I think that leap is so far that, in the end, most Americans will say, 'Democrats, you've lost your credibility here.''There are, of course, some Republicans who have sounded less resolute about supporting Trump. The shakiest of them all is Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.), who told reporters Tuesday that the officials who are testifying deserve respect.'Rooney said lawmakers were caught off guard last week when the president tweeted during testimony by former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch that everywhere she went 'turned bad' <U+2015> a possible example of witness intimidation by the president.'That was a pretty strong tweet from the president of the United States,' Rooney said.'And Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), whose district is only mildly Republican, said he wished the FBI was doing the investigation instead of congressional Democrats. He declined to defend Trump but denigrated the impeachment inquiry.''I want to find the facts, that's what I want,' Fitzpatrick said. 'And this process is not planned to do that when you have partisan politicians doing this investigation.'But, notably, Rooney and Fitzpatrick both voted against even opening the impeachment inquiry <U+2015> along with every other Republican in the House.'Former Republican <U+2015> now independent <U+2015> Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan said his old GOP colleagues were 'caught up in a lot of word games.''The Republicans will use whatever excuse they need to against whichever particular set of witnesses,' Amash said.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"191",1449419824,"These Key Witnesses Won’t Appear At The Impeachment Hearings","The House impeachment inquiry has already featured top diplomats and national security officials sharing damning testimony about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to secure a quid pro quo arrangement with Ukraine's government. When the hearings conclude, we will have heard from numerous administration officials about the scandal <U+2015> but there are many others we won't hear from.'The White House declared in early October that it won't cooperate with the hearings. Top officials have ignored congressional subpoenas and the State Department has ordered employees not to testify. Although some officials have defied the White House and met with investigators, the administration's effort to stymie the inquiry has succeeded in blocking access to several important witnesses. Many of these are officials who could provide the kind of firsthand accounts of Trump's actions that Republicans have accused the inquiry of lacking.'These are some of the most important figures in impeachment who you likely won't see in the hearings:Several top national security officials have not agreed to testify in the hearings, including former national security adviser John Bolton and his deputy Charles Kupperman. Bolton was extremely wary of Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate political rival and 2020 candidate Joe Biden, according to testimony from other officials, and sought to distance himself from being implicated in it.'Bolton reportedly told National Security Council official Fiona Hill to speak with White House lawyers about Giuliani's shadow policy in Ukraine and the problems it was creating, according to Hill's testimony. He also expressed concern about U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney's involvement in pressuring Ukraine.'I'm not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,' Bolton said, according to Hill.''Bolton's lawyer added earlier this month that the former national security adviser and longtime Washington hawk was part of 'many relevant meetings and conversations' related to the impeachment inquiry. But Bolton has refused to appear unless a federal judge rules on whether White House officials are obligated to testify or should be granted immunity. House Democrats have so far decided not to subpoena Bolton, fearing it would result in a protracted legal fight.Deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman, who has been a close Bolton ally for decades, also isn't set to testify after he filed a lawsuit asking a judge whether he should be compelled to comply with a subpoena to appear at the hearings. House Democrats withdrew their subpoena for Kupperman after he filed the suit, seeking to avoid delays in the hearings. Kupperman was on the July 25 call between Zelensky and Trump.These officials would also potentially have knowledge of why the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call was moved to a highly classified server, in what was a deviation from standard White House practices.House investigators subpoenaed Mulvaney earlier this month. He has refused to comply, however, citing a Justice Department argument that current and former senior White House officials should have immunity from congressional subpoenas.Multiple officials have implicated Mulvaney in seeking a quid pro quo arrangement with Ukraine, testifying that Mulvaney appeared to have approved a White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky on the condition that Ukraine's government investigate Biden. Mulvaney also drew attention to himself last month when he told reporters to 'get over it' regarding the scandal, and said 'we do that all the time' about quid pro quos. He later attempted to backtrack on his admission that there was a quid pro quo. Also refusing to testify is Mulvaney's senior adviser, Robert Blair, a top White House national security aide who listened in on the July 25 call.'White House attorney and legal adviser to the National Security Council John Eisenberg has also failed to show up to a deposition and is not scheduled to appear in hearings this week. Eisenberg allegedly moved the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call to a highly classified server after top National Security Council official for Ukraine Lt. Col. Vindman raised concerns about the call, according to Vindman's testimony.Energy Secretary Rick Perry similarly refused to show up for closed-door depositions and ignored a congressional subpoena. Perry was one of three officials who allegedly made up an unofficial back channel that the Trump administration used to communicate with Ukrainian officials and push for investigations into the Bidens. Perry was also running a side campaign to connect his American political backers with Ukraine's government and energy sector, and two of his supporters secured major oil and gas deals during his efforts.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"192",1449433005,"The Day Impeachment Threatens McConnell’s Senate Job Is The Day Trump Is In Big Trouble","WASHINGTON ' Is Mitch McConnell's future as Senate majority leader in 2021 more assured with President Donald Trump at the top of the 2020 Republican ticket? Or with a President Mike Pence?Because while the president's staff is focused on the ongoing impeachment proceedings in the House regarding his attempts to coerce Ukraine into helping his reelection efforts, Trump's ultimate fate is more likely to hinge on the calculations of a single lawmaker from the other chamber, Kentucky's McConnell.And although McConnell would certainly rather keep his control over the Senate and have a Republican in the White House, a number of Republicans predicted that, if Trump's standing among voters were to fall even further, McConnell would choose his own political future over Trump's.'I'm sure he'd prefer both. But, if he has to choose, yes, the Senate is his higher priority,' said one former top GOP congressional aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity to candidly assess McConnell. The former aide could not predict how low that approval rating would have to drop. 'That's the $64,000 question.'On Tuesday, as additional witnesses testified about Trump's efforts to use $391 million in military aid as leverage to force Ukraine to announce politically useful investigations, McConnell told reporters: 'It's inconceivable to me that there will be 67 votes to remove the president from office.'The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote of those present to remove a president who has been impeached by the House. If all 47 Democrats were to vote that way, it would require 20 Republicans to vote with them for Trump to be forced out.'I think most Republicans are going to fall on a spectrum ranging from no big deal to moderately alarmed to believing this was very bad judgment <U+2015> but that it doesn't rise to the level of impeachment,' said Scott Jennings, a GOP consultant in Kentucky and a former McConnell campaign aide. 'I think the White House will need to give Republicans the latitude to express those varying opinions as long as they hold the line against votes to convict.'But Trump's problem is that while he is feared by Republican senators ' and likely less so now than he has been, given recent GOP losses in Kentucky and Louisiana governors' races, despite his campaign visits ' he is not particularly respected or liked. Former GOP Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said that if the Senate were to hold a secret ballot to convict Trump, 'at least 35' Republicans would vote to do so.Which means that Republican senators' loyalty to Trump likely goes no further than to the extent it benefits them politically ' and they could well abandon him if it appears that doing so is more likely to ensure their own reelections.In the case of McConnell, the limits of his loyalty are more likely to be linked to the fates of the half dozen or so of his most vulnerable Republican members in the coming 2020 election. With that current 53-47 majority, if just four Republicans lose reelection, McConnell would no longer be majority leader ' a title he has sought for decades.Meaning Trump's fate will be less tied to his polling in safe, Trump-friendly states than to his approval numbers in places like Colorado, Maine, North Carolina and Arizona, where GOP senators are all facing challenging races.'If Trump is not removed, all those senators lose,' said William Weld, a former Massachusetts governor and a Reagan-era Justice Department official who is now running against Trump for the 2020 GOP nomination.He recalled the aftermath of the 1986 elections, when Republicans lost the Senate. 'It's such a feeling of powerlessness, and it's one that Mitch has had in the past, and he doesn't want to have it back,' he said.Former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh, who is also running for the 2020 GOP presidential nomination, said McConnell's primary goal will be to keep Republican control of the Senate. 'Everything else is a distant second to that,' he said. 'They will dump Trump in a nanosecond if it helps the GOP retain the Senate. And remember, none of the Senate Republicans like or fear Trump. They fear his voters.'Rick Tyler, a Republican political consultant who worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2016 GOP primaries, said McConnell understands that the party is better off without Trump heading into the 2020 election.'McConnell will shrewdly play Trump's game until a clear majority of voters in enough states that Republican senators need to hold to keep control turn on Trump,' Tyler said. 'At that point, he will dump Trump.'Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the House after a whistleblower filed a complaint that the president was withholding congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine unless its leaders announced investigations politically useful to Trump's 2020 reelection.According to witness testimony as well as the rough transcript of Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, Trump demanded that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden as well as support a conspiracy theory which falsely claims that Russian intelligence agencies did not help Trump win the 2016 election, but rather it was Ukrainian officials who framed Russia by using fake evidence. He made the military aid contingent on Ukraine publicly announcing the probes but then backed down after the White House learned that the whistleblower's complaint on the matter was about to reach Congress.John Ryder, a former Republican National Committee member from Tennessee, said few people outside of Washington, D.C., are paying much attention to the impeachment hearings. He said Republicans in particular are wary of the new effort because of the long-running investigation into Trump's relationship with Russia, which did not result in articles of impeachment or a prosecution of the president.'They're suffering a little bit of 'boy who cried wolf' syndrome,' he said, adding that Trump's approval ratings, after dipping a few points when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the start of the impeachment inquiry, are back to the low 40s.He said that if the percentage of people approving of Trump starts falling to the low 30s, senators who currently back Trump will start to rethink that position.

"196",1449521411,"Kurt Volker Says He Was Clueless That Trump’s Desire For Burisma Probe Was About Joe Biden","WASHINGTON <U+2015> Kurt Volker, President Donald Trump's former special envoy to Ukraine, testified that he was oblivious to the connection between President Donald Trump's desire for an investigation into the Ukrainian gas company Burisma and targeting former Vice President Joe Biden.Volker was trying to 'thread the needle' between a Burisma investigation (which Trump desperately wanted and Volker believed could help convince him to continue supporting Ukraine) and a Biden investigation (which he says he knew would be 'unacceptable').''I now understand most of the other people didn't see or consider this distinction,' Volker said of investigating Burisma and investigating the Bidens. 'For them it was synonymous.'It's common for Trump administration officials to believe that they can advance broad policy goals without becoming complicit in anything improper. An anonymous administration official has insisted to the public that they are working diligently to 'preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump's more misguided impulses.' Respected national security officials like John Kelly, H.R. McMaster, and Jim Mattis all thought they could serve as the adults in the room. They all resigned after realizing the futility of that goal.'Before Trump was elected president, Volker and friends joked that none of them would want to work in the Trump administration ' but they each wanted the other to do it and serve as the voice of reason.'Volker felt committed to Ukraine's future and the fight against Russia, he said Tuesday. He hoped that he could get a skeptical Trump to support that effort by convincing the Ukrainians to give the president what he wanted. But Volker soon learned that the only way to get Trump on board was with what amounted to a demand that a country deeply dependent on U.S. military aid help advance the president's personal political ambitions.Volker claimed that he thought there was a distinction between 'Burisma' and 'Biden,' and that he saw investigating them as 'different <U+2015> the former being appropriate and unremarkable, the latter being unacceptable.'When U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland brought up the investigations during a meeting with Ukrainian officials, it was an 'eye-roll moment,' Volker said Tuesday.'In retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections,' Volker told the House Intelligence Committee in an open hearing on Tuesday afternoon.'Volker later admitted that he ' knew that [Hunter Biden] had been a board member,' but said that he believed that investigating Burisma and investigating former Vice President Biden were 'very different things.'Volker is the first of the 'three amigos' at the center of the Trump-Ukraine scandal to testify in the impeachment inquiry <U+2015> Sondland will appear before the committee tomorrow, while Energy Secretary Rick Perry isn't scheduled to testify.'Volker texted a Ukranian official that they would set up a White House meeting after 'President Z convinces trump he will investigate/'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016.'Tim Morrison, a White House National Security Council official who testified alongside Volker, told lawmakers that he was hoping that Trump would have given Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky more support in their phone call in July.Volker said that he didn't think that the United States foreign policy should be focused on pursuing 'conspiracy theories' he believed the Ukranians were floating.'I don't think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these things I consider to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians <U+2015> particularly the former prosecutor general <U+2015> they're not things that we should be pursuing as part of our national security strategy with Ukraine,' Volker said.'This article has been updated with Volker's comment about Ambassador Gordon Sondland.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"197",1449532753,"GOP-Requested Witness Rejects Trump ‘Conspiracy Theories’","WASHINGTON (AP) ' Sought by Republicans to testify, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine spoke up instead for Democrat Joe Biden in Tuesday's impeachment hearings, rejecting 'conspiracy theories' embraced by President Donald Trump and some of his allies.Kurt Volker said he has known Biden as an honorable man for more than two decades, rebuffing debunked corruption allegations that Trump is said to have wanted the Ukrainians to investigate in exchange for military aid to hold off Russian aggression.'The allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and non-credible,' Volker declared.Broader corruption in Ukraine was 'plausible,' but corruption by Biden wasn't, he said.Volker testified alongside former White House national security official Tim Morrison in the second hearing of the day in the House's impeachment inquiry, only the fourth in history against a U.S. president.Morrison, also requested by GOP members on the House Intelligence Committee, said at the outset that he was not there to question the 'character or integrity' of any of his colleagues, though earlier Tuesday Republican lawmakers used his prior comments to try to discredit another witness, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. The White House even circulated a tweet that was an earlier quote by Morrison questioning Vindman's judgment.Democrats say there may be grounds for impeachment in Trump's push for Ukraine's new leadership to investigate his Democratic rival and the 2016 U.S. election as he withheld military assistance approved by Congress.Trump says he did nothing wrong and dismissed the hearings as a 'kangaroo court.'Volker was the first person to come behind closed doors in the inquiry that started in September, resigning his position shortly before he did so.Since then, a parade of witnesses has testified publicly and privately about what they recalled about the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine's new leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Many of those statements cast doubt on Volker's account that he didn't know the Ukraine gas company Burisma was tied to Biden, and that he wasn't aware of a possible quid pro quo offered by Trump.A number of White House and State Department officials were listening to the call, but Volker was not.On Tuesday, he said he opposed any hold on security assistance. And he said, 'I did not understand that others believed that any investigation of the Ukrainian company, Burisma, which had a history of accusations of corruption, was tantamount to investigating Vice President Biden. I drew a distinction between the two.'Even though, he said, he understood that Biden's son Hunter had been a board member <U+2015> and he himself had been deeply involved with Ukrainian officials on a statement, never released, that would have committed the country to investigating Burisma and the 2016 U.S. election.Volker himself requested a meeting on July 19 with Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, at which Giuliani mentioned accusations about the Bidens as well as the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.He said he believes now, thanks to hindsight and the testimony of other witnesses, that Trump was using the aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden and his role on the company's board.'In retrospect I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections,' Volker testified.Yet he also acknowledged that Trump never told him he was withholding aid for Ukraine unless there were investigations. He also said Ukrainians never told him that they wouldn't get a White House visit or military aid without committing to investigations. He said he would have objected had the president asked him to get Ukraine to do investigations.Morrison, who stepped down from Trump's National Security Council shortly before he appeared behind closed doors last month, said he was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed on Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine's leader, testimony that Republicans have repeatedly highlighted.'As I stated during my deposition, I feared at the time of the call on July 25th how its disclosure would play in Washington's political climate,' he said Tuesday. 'My fears have been realized.'He told lawmakers Tuesday that the transcript of the call was incorrectly placed in a highly secure location.Democrats have seen ill intent in that action, but he said, 'It was a mistake ... an administrative error.'Morrison has confirmed to investigators that he witnessed a key September conversation in Warsaw between Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and a Ukrainian official. Sondland told the official that U.S. aid might be freed if the country's top prosecutor 'would go to the mike and announce that he was opening the Burisma investigation,' Morrison said in previous closed-door testimony.Volker shifted his account of a pivotal July 10 interaction at the White House. In his closed-door interview last month, he said there was no discussion of Giuliani's activities in Ukraine or investigations sought by the president.But on Tuesday, he said the meeting was essentially over when Sondland made a 'general' comment about investigations.'I think all of us thought it was inappropriate; the conversation did not continue and the meeting concluded,' Volker said.A series of text messages Volker provided to lawmakers showed conversations between him, Sondland and another envoy in which they discussed a need for Ukraine to launch investigations, including into Burisma.Volker said meeting with Giuliani was just part of the dialogue, and he had one in-person meeting with him, in which Giuliani 'raised, and I rejected, the conspiracy theory that Vice President Biden would have been influenced in his duties as vice president by money paid to his son.'Volker also said a senior aide to Zelenskiy approached him last summer to ask to be connected to Giuliani. He said he made clear to the Zelenskiy aide, Andriy Yermak, that Giuliani was a private citizen and not a representative of the U.S. government.He testified he wasn't part of an irregular foreign policy channel led Giuliani, as others have testified. He also rejected the idea that Trump dubbed him, Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry the 'three amigos' in charge of Ukraine policy.'My role was not some irregular channel, but the official channel,' Volker said.___Associated Press Writers Mary Clare Jalonick, Matthew Daly, Alan Fram, Lisa Mascaro and Laurie Kellman contributed to this report.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"205",1449842793,"Democratic Voters Aren’t Confident Their Presidential Candidates Will Get Much Done","Democrats are skeptical that their leading 2020 presidential candidates will be able to accomplish much of their stated agendas, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted ahead of the fifth Democratic presidential debate on Wednesday night.Just 41% of Democrats think former Vice President Joe Biden will be able to accomplish all or most of his policy goals, and the numbers are lower for other candidates: Only 33% say the same of Sen. Elizabeth Warren's agenda, while 30% of Democrats are confident in Sen. Bernie Sanders' ability to enact his political revolution and just 28% believe South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg can enact most of his plans.'The lack of confidence comes as each of the three leading candidates doubles down on their own personal theories of how to enact the Democratic Party's agenda <U+2015> and as each of those theories runs into stark challenges.'Warren, the senator from Massachusetts who wants to change Washington's internal rules to make progressive change easier, might not have support among Democrats to get rid of the Senate's 60-vote filibuster threshold. Biden is continuing to tout his ability to work with Republicans amid widespread skepticism. And Sanders, a Vermont independent who is counting on popular support to pressure a Congress reluctant to embrace his ambitious policies, has seen support for his signature policy fall as the campaign advances.Meanwhile, Buttigieg <U+2015> who trails the other three in national polling but is running strong in the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire <U+2015> is still articulating how his plans to pass legislation would differ from unsuccessful tactics used by President Barack Obama's administration.The HuffPost/YouGov poll found a plurality of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (43%) thought a reform approach, including weakening the power of lobbyists and corporations to influence policy, was the most effective way for Democrats to pass laws if they win the presidency in 2020. That approach, typically associated with Warren, was more popular than Biden's preferred method of finding common ground with Republicans. Thirty percent of Democrats supported a compromise approach.'The least popular was Sanders' preferred method of enlisting ordinary people to pressure elected officials to support progressive goals. Only 12% supported this method.There are ideological differences: 51% of liberals preferred a reform approach, and just 25% want to find common ground with Republicans. Among moderates and conservatives, 44% prefer looking for common ground with Republicans, while 28% want to weaken lobbyists and corporations. There's also a significant age gap: Democrats older than 65 have a strong preference for working with Republicans.'These divides were clear at a Warren rally Sunday in Las Vegas. The candidate ran through her ambitious agenda: a wealth tax on fortunes of more than $50 million, substantial investments in early childhood education, an elimination of student debt, a sweeping anti-corruption law. But audience members varied wildly in how much of her agenda they expected her to accomplish and whether her plan to win political victories was the best.Dylan Jaramillo, an electrical engineer who said he's likely to support businessman Andrew Yang in the primary, said he liked Yang's (and Biden's) emphasis on working with Republicans to get things done.'Joe Biden is probably the most realistic one,' he said, predicting Warren would achieve 'maybe 30%' of her goals.Jenna Wurtzberger, an adjunct professor, attended the rally with Byron McDonald, a delivery driver. Both supported Warren's push to get rid of the filibuster and thought Biden's hopes to work with Republicans were far-fetched.'You can't talk sense with Republicans at this point,' Wurtzberger said.'I've watched enough of the impeachment inquiry,' McDonald said in agreement. 'For Biden, that seems a little pie in the sky.'But McDonald still wasn't totally sold on voting for Warren. 'I support big ideas. But I worry not everyone likes big ideas as much as I do.'Warren's pitch on how she would transform her famous plans into reality has shifted slightly. In her stump speech, she no longer mentions her work with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to pass legislation lowering the price of hearing aids. She also now spends more time invoking famous social movements of the past, suggesting a similar movement can push Congress to adopt her ambitious liberal agenda.And some of the roadblocks for Warren's theory have reappeared. Three Democratic senators <U+2015> West Virginia's Joe Manchin, Arizona's Kyrsten Sinema and Montana's Jon Tester <U+2015> recently reiterated their opposition to ending the filibuster, which would force Warren to somehow court GOP support for her plans.''(In the HuffPost/YouGov poll, voters were ambivalent about the filibuster: 29% said it was a good rule, 25% said it was a bad rule and 46% were unsure. Among Democrats, however, 27% said it was a good rule and 33% said it was bad.)Sanders and Biden, meanwhile, have stuck to their guns. Biden, who was widely mocked for predicting Republicans would have an 'epiphany' after Trump's presidency, repeated the line at a fundraiser at K Street law firm in Washington, D.C. Sanders remains committed to a broad political revolution.The new entrant into the top-tier of the race, Buttigieg, has expressed elements of each theory of change put forward by the other leading candidates. Like Warren, he supports eliminating the filibuster. Like Biden, he emphasizes reuniting the country and working with Republicans. And like Sanders, he talks about applying public pressure on reluctant politicians.''There's a big airplane that comes with the Oval Office, right?,' Buttigieg said at a town hall in Iowa earlier this month. 'I believe the best use of that airplane's to fire it up, fly it into the district or the state of a senator or a member of Congress getting in the way of one of these measures.'But when asked how his approach would differ from that of Obama, who saw his agenda curtailed significantly by both Republicans and intra-party opposition, Buttigieg struggled to answer.'He operated under the constraints of being the last Democrat of the Reagan era. And he also faced constraints of a Congress that was not acting in good faith,' Buttigieg said during his bus tour in Iowa. 'And the part about Congress acting in bad faith has only gotten worse among Republicans.''I think the dynamics of the country have become more favorable,' he added. 'I mean, just 12 years <U+2015> I don't know what percent of the country is different over a 12-year period. But just 12 years' worth of people who have arrived and left. That means that this country has shifted <U+2015> plus 12 years of experience as a country on what works and what doesn't work.'Ultimately, Buttigieg concluded, he would have a mandate if he won the election.'You look at how the New Deal came about, it's not that FDR promised something even bigger than the New Deal and then he got there and that was the compromise,' he said. 'It was a much more kind of dynamic set of things that happened. On health care, in modern times, you could look at the example of the [Affordable Care Act]. You could also look at the example of the Clinton health care reform agenda in the '90s. And the biggest lesson I draw is that if we're really explicit about what we want to do now, then you arrive in office with a mandate to do it.'Daniel Marans and Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed reporting.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Nov. 15-17 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

"206",1449888110,"Gordon Sondland Faces Tough Questions About Trump, Ukraine","WASHINGTON (AP) ' Ambassador Gordon Sondland, the most anticipated witness in'the impeachment inquiry,'will confront questions Wednesday about his evolving accounts of the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine and a newly revealed summertime phone call with President Donald Trump.Sondland, a wealthy hotelier Trump tapped as his ambassador to the European Union, is more directly entangled than any witness yet in'the Republican president's efforts'to get Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and Democrats in the 2016 election. Yet Sondland has already amended his testimony once '''I now do recall,''he said, talking to Ukraine about investigations.Sondland's appearance at Wednesday morning's hearing, and his closeness to Trump, is of particular concern to the White House as the'historic impeachment inquiry'reaches closer to the president, pushing through an intense week with nine witnesses testifying over three days in back-to-back sessions.Trump has recently tried to suggest that he barely knows his hand-picked ambassador, but Sondland has said he has spoken several times with the president and was acting on his direction.The envoy is likely to face tough questions from lawmakers of both parties about'Trump's July 25 call'when he asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the political investigations at the same time as U.S. military aid for the ally was being stalled.Sondland routinely bragged about his proximity to Trump and drew alarm from the foreign service and national security apparatus as part of an irregular channel of diplomacy led by the president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani.Last week State Department official'David Holmes'revealed one of those interactions to impeachment investigators, saying he recalled it 'vividly.'The political counselor was having lunch with Sondland in Kyiv when the ambassador dialed up the president on his cellphone and Holmes could hear Trump's voice.'I then heard President Trump ask, quote, 'So he's going to do the investigation?'' Holmes testified. 'Ambassador Sondland replied that 'He's going to do it,' adding that President Zelensky will, quote, 'do anything you ask him to.''Sondland was known for telling others 'he was in charge of Ukraine' despite being the U.S. envoy in Brussels, said another witness in the impeachment probe, former White House Russia adviser Fiona Hill.'And I asked, well, on whose authority?' said Hill, who will testify Thursday. 'And he said, the President.'Sondland's appearance follows the testimony Tuesday of four national security and diplomatic officials, including a career Army officer who described Trump's call with Zelenskiy as 'improper.'Lt. Col.'Alexander Vindman'told lawmakers it was his 'duty' to report his concerns about the call, as he deflected Republican attacks, including from the White House on his loyalty and career in public service.It wasn't the first time Vindman had registered his concerns over Ukraine policy. He testified about a July 10 meeting at the White House when Sondland told visiting Ukraine officials they would need to 'deliver' before the administration would agree to a meeting Zelenskiy wanted with Trump.'Ambassador Sondland referred to investigations into the Bidens and Burisma in 2016,' Vindman testified, referring to the gas company on whose board Hunter Biden had a seat.At the White House, Trump said he had watched part of the day's testimony and slammed the ongoing impeachment hearings as a 'disgrace.' Over the weekend, Trump assailed Williams as part of the 'Never Trumpers' who oppose his presidency, though there is no indication she has shown any partisanship.Former National Security Council official Timothy Morrison told investigators that he witnessed a key September conversation in Warsaw between Sondland and a top aide to Zelenskiy. Afterward, Sondland said he had relayed to the Ukrainian that U.S. aid might be freed if the country would announce the investigations, Morrison testified.Another diplomat, former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, shifted his own account of the July 10 meeting to say Sondland did, in fact, discuss investigations with the visiting Ukrainians.'I think all of us thought it was inappropriate; the conversation did not continue and the meeting concluded,' Volker said.A series of text messages Volker provided to lawmakers showed conversations between him, Sondland and other leaders in which they discussed a need for Ukraine to launch investigations, including into Burisma.Volker said meeting with Giuliani was just part of the dialogue, and he had one in-person meeting with him, in which Giuliani 'raised, and I rejected, the conspiracy theory that Vice President Biden would have been influenced in his duties as vice president by money paid to his son.'___Associated Press writers Alan Fram, Zeke Miller, Laurie Kellman, Colleen Long, Eric Tucker, Lolita Baldor and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The ambassador was in Kyiv at the time and stated that he and the president did not discuss any classified information at that time.In clarifying what the call entailed, Sondland said: 'Other witnesses have recently shared their recollection of overhearing this call. For the most part, I have no reason to doubt their accounts. It is true that the president speaks loudly at times. And it's also true, I think we primarily discussed A$AP Rocky. It is true that the President likes to use colorful language.'""I think we primarily discussed ASAP Rocky.""

At the time, Trump''offered to personally vouch for [Rocky's] bail,' though Sweden has no bail system.On Wednesday, Sondland doubled down on the mention of the 31-year-old artist and said later in his testimony that his memory of the July 26 call with Trump was triggered by someone's reference to A$AP Rocky. He claimed that discussing the rapper was the 'primary purpose of the call.'ASAP Rocky's name being mentioned during an impeachment hearing is peak 2019 pic.twitter.com/121iM5Bi8x'Here's what the peanut gallery, AKA Twitter, had to say about the mentions:It gives me great delight to think that decades from now, scholars studying these hearings will encounter the phrase 'it is also true we discussed A$AP Rocky.'ASAP Rocky name being mentioned in a an impeachment inquiry is insaneA$AP Rocky is going to have to testify.somewhere @asvpxrocky's notifications are blowing up and he's like seriously what in the hell is going on right nowAsap Rocky when he heard Ambassador Sondland say his name #sondlandtestimony pic.twitter.com/9a7UNO5iOmSondland testifies that his memory was refreshed when other witnesses recalled Trump discussing A$AP Rocky on the call.Now there are verses on 'praise the lord' that apply here, but we don't even have time for that right now.The decision by the 2019 Writer's Room to get ASAP Rocky into the impeachment narrative is why they should win an Emmy this yeari was NOT expecting to hear ASAP Rocky's name.Yes ASAP Rocky has been cited and will now forever be part of the historical record of the impeachment of the 45th President of the United States of America.A$AP Rocky has now earned his place in American presidential history.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"211",1450131093,"Trump Wanted A TV Announcement To Tar Biden, Not An Actual Probe, Sondland Says","Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, testified on Wednesday that President Donald Trump cared most that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky publicly announce an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden and the company that employed his son, not that Ukraine actually conduct the probe.'He had to announce the investigations,' Sondland said during the House impeachment inquiry, referring to Zelensky. 'He didn't actually have to do them, as I understood it.'The point is essential in that it reveals that Trump did not care about corruption in Ukraine, as his GOP allies in Congress have attempted to argue<U+FEFF>. Instead the president simply wanted a television clip that could be used to implicate a potential 2020 Democratic presidential opponent in a criminal investigation.'I never heard ... anyone say the investigations had to start or had to be completed,' Sondland said.He noted the only information he was provided was that Trump wanted Zelensky to make a public statement announcing investigations into Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company that employed Hunter Biden, and whether Ukraine, and not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election. The only reason that Sondland said he was given for this was that Ukrainian officials had previously made promises in private that they did not deliver.Sondland's statements fit with other testimony from witnesses and evidence from call records that Trump never raised broader issues of corruption in Ukraine or actual anti-corruption policy in his conversations with Zelensky. Instead, he focused on specific investigations; one that could help him win the 2020 election, and another that could cloud the stain of how he won the 2016 election.A televised announcement by Ukraine could be extremely useful for the Trump campaign if Biden were to win the Democratic presidential primary to face the president in 2020. It could be referred to at rallies, used in television and internet advertisements, and Trump-friendly news organizations could use it in clips to make claims of corruption against Biden.This could allow Trump to rerun his 2016 playbook, where he used the FBI investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server to make broad claims of criminal corruption against her. The New York Times claimed at the time that the then-FBI director James Comey's first announcement in July 2016 about the Clinton investigation provided a 'ready-made attack ad' for Trump.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"214",1450153819,"A GOP Ambassador Destroyed Republican Talking Points On The Ukraine Scandal","The most damning testimony of the House impeachment hearings came on Wednesday, when a lifelong Republican chosen by President Donald Trump to be ambassador to the European Union eviscerated every talking point the GOP has put out about the Ukraine scandal.'Everyone was in the loop,' Sondland said of the campaign to pressure Ukraine into helping Trump politically.'We followed the president's orders,' he added, saying there indeed was a 'quid pro quo.'In his testimony Wednesday morning, Sondland made clear that it was widely known in the administration that Trump wanted Ukraine to do his bidding on political investigations, in exchange for favorable U.S. foreign policy treatment.Sondland's testimony was incredibly damaging for Republicans. The ways they've tried to discredit the other witnesses or downplay the scandal went out the window with Sondland, and they struggled to lodge critiques that will stick. Some of the excuses Republicans have used thus far:'Republicans have gone after other officials who have testified <U+2015> such as Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, a State Department official responsible for Ukraine <U+2015> by saying that they didn't witness key events. With other individuals who did have some firsthand knowledge, Republicans have dismissed them as being bit players who didn't talk regularly to Trump.That doesn't work with Sondland, who spoke regularly to Trump. Other witnesses testified that they understood that Sondland had regular access to the president, and Sondland himself underscored that in his testimony.When asked Wednesday whether he told Trump that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky 'loves your ass,' Sondland replied, 'Sounds like something I would say. That's how President Trump and I communicate. A lot of four-letter words. In this case a three-letter.''Yet Trump spoke to reporters while Sondland was testifying, saying he didn't know Sondland well:''I have not spoken to him much. This is not a man I know well. He seems like a nice guy though.'Pam Bondi, the new White House communications director for impeachment, went on TV and said Sondland was just a 'short-term ambassador' to Ukraine. (He was never ambassador to Ukraine; he is ambassador to the EU.)Prior to last week's House Intelligence Committee hearing with Taylor and Kent, Trump tweeted, 'NEVER TRUMPERS!' Trump also said Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence who testified on Tuesday, was part of the same group. All denied that characterization.The 'Never Trumper' moniker can't be applied to Sondland. He's a lifelong Republican who initially supported former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in the 2016 Republican presidential primary but then readily got on board with Trump. He became an ambassador through a well-trodden practice used by both parties <U+2015> donating lots of money. Sondland contributed $1 million to Trump's inauguration committee.Brent Bozell, a conservative commentator, tweeted that Sondland showed why the American people elected Trump to 'get rid of people like Sondland.' Of course, Trump picked Sondland to be his ambassador to the EU. Bozell must have even realized how lame this attack was, and he deleted his tweet.'There's no question that Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer who has no government role, was operating in a highly unusual <U+2015> and inappropriate <U+2015> fashion in the Ukraine scandal. He was able to leverage U.S. foreign policy in ways meant to benefit only Trump politically and personally.Sondland, other witnesses testified, was part of this rogue operation. And there was the possibility, therefore, that they were acting on their own, without the knowledge of those at the top <U+2015> including Trump himself.Sondland shot down that theory Wednesday. He said it was 'no secret' what they were doing. Among the officials Sondland named as knowing what was going on: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney; Mulvaney's senior adviser Rob Blair; Pompeo's counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl; Lisa Kenna, the State Department executive secretary; John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser at the time; Bolton's deputy Fiona Hill; and Timothy Morrison, who replaced Hill.One of the biggest recent revelations in the Ukraine investigation is that David Holmes, a U.S. embassy official in Ukraine, overheard Sondland talking on the phone to Trump, telling him Zelensky 'loves your ass,' to which Trump replied, 'So he's going to do the investigation?'When Holmes asked Sondland what Trump's views on Ukraine were, Sondland reportedly said, 'The president did not give a shit about Ukraine.' For him, it was all about the political investigations.The existence of the call seemed to put Trump more directly at the heart of the scandal, obsessed with using foreign policy for his political benefit. But Sondland, in his testimony Wednesday, said he barely remembered the call <U+2015> because it was so unremarkable.'I would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations,' he said.Yet on Wednesday, a key tactic seemed to be making it seem like Sondland didn't know what was in Trump's mind <U+2015> and also throwing Giuliani under the bus.Sondland said that when Trump told him and other officials on May 23 to 'talk to Rudy,' he took that as an order to talk to Giuliani and follow his instructions on what to do about Ukraine. In other words, Giuliani spoke for Trump.But Republicans claim that what Trump wanted was still unknowable, because he never expressly told Sondland to hold up aid until Ukraine carried out the political investigations.'Sondland never testified that it was the 'express direction' of the President to pressure Ukraine or push a quid pro quo,' the Trump campaign said in an email sent Wednesday.Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) accused Sondland of 'made-up testimony.'This tactic has been more tailored for Sondland, who has been an unreliable witness and has changed his testimony since the time he first spoke to lawmakers behind closed doors. (It was tougher to pull off with Taylor, for example, who took meticulous contemporaneous notes.)Steve Castor, the GOP counsel questioning Sondland during the hearing, tried to make it seem like the ambassador simply doesn't remember anything: 'You don't have records. You don't have your notes because you didn't take notes. You don't have a lot of recollections. I mean, this is the trifecta of unreliability.'But Sondland said the reason he can't recall as much is, in part, the fault of the administration, which has refused to let him view all his phone records, State Department emails and other documents. He said he was also told that he couldn't work with his staff to pull together the relevant files.'My lawyers and I have made multiple requests to the State Department and the White House for these materials. Yet, these materials were not provided to me. They have also refused to share these materials with this committee. These documents are not classified and, in fairness, should have been made available. In the absence of these materials, my memory has not been perfect,' he said. 'And I have no doubt that a more fair, open and orderly process of allowing me to read the State Department records would have made this process more transparent.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Asked whether the former vice president has spent much time watching the impeachment hearings, a senior campaign official said no but that they've been 'helpful.''They've really reminded people of two things: One, that you have Trump administration officials testifying under oath that Vice President Biden did nothing wrong,' the official said.The official continued: 'And two, you're fundamentally reminding voters every day that Donald Trump doesn't want to have to face Joe Biden at the ballot box and that's why he's being impeached in the first place.'The House's impeachment inquiry centers on Trump's efforts to get Ukraine to launch a political investigation into Biden and his alleged decision to use U.S. military aid to the country as leverage.The Biden campaign declined to discuss internal polling that may have demonstrated how impeachment is benefiting the former vice president, pointing to public polling and news headlines generally to show the 'net benefit' to Biden's campaign.As other Democratic candidates like Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have seen their support in the polls climb and then dip in recent months, Biden has remained the steady front-runner.Americans remain split on whether Congress should impeach and vote to remove Trump from office, according to a PBSNewsHour, NPR and Marist poll released Tuesday. The poll shows little change in public attitudes since the public hearings began last week.A Quinnipiac University poll'of likely Democratic voters in South Carolina out this week showed Biden at 33% <U+2015> a 20-point lead over the rest of the Democratic pack.

Who would have benefited from an investigation of the president's political opponents?'

Sondland engage in a tense exchange about who would benefit from an investigation of Joe Biden. pic.twitter.com/iDDAGz75yvThe question was in reference to a call at the center of the impeachment inquiry in which Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, his political rival, while discussing U.S. aid to Ukraine.Sondland dodged Maloney's questions, saying, 'I don't want to characterize who would have and who would not have.'Maloney, growing visibly frustrated, asked him five more times to answer him until Sondland said:''I assume President Trump would benefit.''There we have it,' Maloney said. 'See, didn't hurt a bit, did it?'Sondland's testimony Wednesday has been largely damning to Trump, with Sondland admitting that the primary focus for Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani was to leverage aid to Ukraine in order to get the country to investigate Biden, whose son once worked for the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, along with other conspiracy theories.'Everyone was in the loop. There were no secrets,' Sondland said of Trump's pressure on Zelensky.Trump, meanwhile, attempted to characterize Sondland's testimony as a positive, claiming he had been vindicated and that the impeachment hearings should come to a close.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"219",1450353454,"Ukrainians Knew About Military Aid Problems As Early As July 25: Testimony","Ukrainian embassy staffers were aware something was holding up U.S. military aid to their country as early as July 25, the day President Donald Trump pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Defense Department official Laura Cooper testified Wednesday evening.Cooper told the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment inquiry into Trump that her staff received emails from Ukrainian officials based in Washington on July 25 asking what was going on with the $391 million in military and security aid. The emails came five hours after the phone call where Trump asked Zelensky to 'do us a favor' by investigating the Bidens business activities in Ukraine.Previous reports had put early August as the earliest date Ukraine officials were aware that the military aid was being blocked.U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordan Sondland testified earlier on Wednesday that Trump directed a quid pro quo where Zelensky could obtain a White House meeting if he were to announce investigations into possible Ukraine interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and Burisma, the gas company that employed Hunter Biden as a board member. Sondland also said he later came to believe that the military aid was part of the quid pro quo.National Security Council staffer Alexander Vindman first learned that a hold was placed on the aid on July 3. The Office of Management and Budget issued an agency memorandum officially blocking release of the aid on July 18 on Trump's order. This came despite Department of Defense officials telling Congress in February and again in May that Ukraine met conditions to receive the aid. The hold on the aid was first reported publicly by Politico on August 28.Cooper had previously testified behind closed doors that she first learned that Ukrainians knew that something had snagged delivery of the military aid on Sept. 5. After her testimony was released to the public, her staff approached her with the July 25 emails from the Ukrainian embassy officials.In desperation to secure the aid, Zelensky and his team had planned to announce investigations into the 2016 election issue and the Bidens on CNN. But on Sept. 9, the intelligence community's inspector general told the House Intelligence Committee about a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's comments in his July 25 phonecall with Zelensky.Three House committees responded by announcing an investigation into the Trump administration's policy toward Ukraine. Two days later, the White House released the aid.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here's how.",2019-11-20 19:09:38

"221",1450353416,"Sondland’s Testimony Was A Bombshell. Republicans Pretended It Was A Dud.","WASHINGTON <U+2015> Gordon Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union and the'man at the center of the Ukraine controversy, testified before Congress on Wednesday that President Donald Trump conditioned security aid and a meeting with the Ukrainian president at the White House upon on Ukraine investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, giving Democrats their most potent sound bite yet.'Was there a quid pro quo?' Sondland asked himself. 'The answer is yes.'But for Republicans, somehow, Sondland's testimony exonerated Trump.'Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) called Sondland's testimony 'a nothing-burger.'Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), while admitting he didn't see any of Sondland's testimony, said it was 'all hearsay.'And House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) described Sondland's testimony as 'scrambled eggs.''A yolk for them, a yolk for us,' Biggs said.Like many Republicans Wednesday night, Biggs disregarded Sondland's claim that aid and a White House meeting were conditional on the Ukrainian president announcing an investigation into Biden,'because Sondland also testified that Trump never directly said that it was a quid pro quo ' the existence of one was Sondland's impression.'There's no evidence anywhere else around,' Biggs said of the quid pro quo.That, of course, ignores a lot of evidence. For starters, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky didn't get his White House meeting, and the U.S. security aid for Ukraine was held up. Even if you believe the GOP line that Trump delayed the aid because he was doing due diligence, that doesn't explain why he wouldn't agree to meeting Zelensky at the White House. And, even more damning, the aid was only released after the existence of a whistleblower complaint about the situation became public.In the words of former Republican Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan <U+2015> now an Independent <U+2015> Republicans are relying on simply confusing the public.'They talk about it like we're all stupid, like we can't see what's going on,' Amash told HuffPost, in an elevator full of his former Republican colleagues. 'Sondland testified to a quid pro quo. He testified to significant details and facts. He testified that he thought it was wrong. So the inference is obvious that the president was withholding security assistance.'When we pressed Amash on what he would say to GOP legislators <U+2015> like the ones standing beside him in the elevator <U+2015> who say it's not obvious, Amash was not sympathetic.'It just is,' he said. 'If this were any grand jury proceeding, it would be obvious to everyone.'Predictably, that is not how Republicans see it. Despite Trump freezing the aid and not acquiescing to a White House meeting, Republicans are focused on the fact that the aid was eventually released.'My biggest problem with the whole thing is that it's like an armed robbery without a weapon, without a product that's been stolen and without a victim that's been robbed,' Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said Wednesday. 'All of this planning that was apparently going on that didn't come to pass.'Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), who was in the elevator during Amash's interview, suggested the comparisons to a grand jury aren't apt because the federal standards of evidence weren't being used for the impeachment hearings.''If it were, almost all of this information, almost every single shred of it, would be inadmissible,' he said.Generally, Republicans were all over the place in their defense of Trump Wednesday night.'Some of it was muted and general <U+2015> Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) told HuffPost that 'nothing stands out to me that's troubling,' before insisting we get in touch with his communications director <U+2015> while other defenses were animated and extremely specific.Diaz-Balart said foreign aid gets tied up all the time. He offered the defense that everyone was misinterpreting the president. He went on an extended rant about how the press wasn't adequately arguing for transparency in the Intelligence Committee's investigation. (While the Intelligence Committee did initially depose witnesses behind closed doors, it has been releasing transcripts of those depositions and holding public hearings for the last week.)Other Republicans offered a smorgasbord of defenses. Perry was particularly concerned that Democrats were blocking an investigation into Hunter Biden.'Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said even the 'worst interpretation' was still acceptable. 'There's nothing impeachable,' King said. '[Trump] has a constitutional right to ask that corruption be eliminated.''And Biggs complained about the National Security Council's Ukraine expert, Alexander Vindman, deviating from the chain of command to report his concerns about Trump's call with Zelensky.''Now see, here's the problem, you get me going on this stuff,' Biggs said.But if there was one consistent part of Sondland's testimony Wednesday that Republicans homed in on, it was the president saying 'no quid pro quo.''In his deposition last month, Sondland described a September 9 phone call with the president during which he asked Trump what he wanted from Zelensky.'I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo,' Trump said, according to Sondland. 'I want Zelensky to do the right thing.'Trump is so convinced that the September call vindicates him that he held an impromptu press conference on the White House lawn on Wednesday with notes that mirrored those quotes from the call.Intelligence Committee member Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) <U+2015> perhaps the president's biggest defender in Congress <U+2015> castigated Sondland for omitting the September call from his Wednesday testimony, calling the call 'the best direct evidence' about the president's involvement in the Ukraine scandal.'The entire thrust of Sondland's testimony was that the president had, in fact, demanded a quid pro quo. At the time of the call, Sondland said Wednesday, he still believed that, contrary to what the president said, Trump still wanted Zelensky to announce investigations in order to get the military assistance and the White House visit that had been promised.'After the hearing, HuffPost asked Jordan if he was just insisting that everyone take the president at his word.''The president said 'no quid pro quo,'' Jordan said. 'He wants Zelensky to do what he campaigned on, plain and simple, speaks for itself. And oh, by the way, that matches the facts, because he never announced that there was going to be an investigation.'Republicans <U+2015> who initially settled on the defense that, as long as there was no quid pro quo, there was nothing improper about wanting a foreign government to investigate the Bidens <U+2015> have now moved to a new stage: As long as Trump denied the quid pro or didn't make it explicit, it's fine.White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement Wednesday where she clung to the idea that President Trump 'clearly stated that he 'wanted nothing' from Ukraine and repeated 'no quid pro quo' over and over again.''The U.S. aid to Ukraine flowed, no investigation was launched, and President Trump has met and spoken with President Zelensky,' Grisham continued. 'Democrats are chasing ghosts.'That statement ignores a number of facts. For one, as Trump was saying he 'wanted nothing,' he was also saying he wanted Ukraine to 'do the right thing.' According to the rough transcript of the July 25 phone call, Trump told Zelensky to do him a 'favor' and investigate Ukraine's role in 2016 election interference. He also brought up 'the other thing:' investigating the Bidens. Sondland said that a White House meeting and the security aid were conditioned on Ukraine announcing an investigation. Explaining his deductive reasoning on determining that it was a quid pro quo, Sondland said it was simply '2+2.''The aid only 'flowed' to Ukraine after the existence of whistleblower's complaint was made public. (You can read all about the timeline of when the aid was released here.) Furthermore, with questions about a quid pro quo already cropping up in the media, and the aid now headed to Ukraine, Zelensky canceled an interview with CNN where he planned to announce the investigations.Once there were reports of a whistleblower complaint, CNN host Fareed Zakaria said, 'it became clear to us that the interview was off.'And finally, while Trump has met and spoken with Zelensky, the Ukrainian president didn't get the meeting at the White House that he desired.Still, Republicans continue to pretend there could not have been a quid pro quo because the aid was eventually released, Zelensky met with Trump, and there have been no investigations.'It's not 2+2,' Jordan said during the hearing. 'It's 0 for 3.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here's how.",2019-11-20 19:52:35
"222",1450353377,"With ‘No Quid Pro Quo’ Defense Shredded, Trump Left With ‘I Can Do Whatever I Want’","WASHINGTON <U+2015> Explosive testimony from a hotelier who turned a $1 million inaugural donation into a glamorous ambassadorship has largely left the White House with a single defense of President Donald Trump: that coercing foreign leaders into investigating a political rival is completely legal and not at all impeachable.Trump, his White House staff and his allies have for weeks been pointing to a Sept. 9 text message from Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, to his State Department colleagues, describing a phone conversation he'd had with Trump: 'The president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind.'But in an impeachment hearing Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee, Sondland testified that not only was there a quid pro quo with Ukraine, but virtually every top official in the Trump administration was well aware of it.'Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously ' the answer is yes,' Sondland said in his opening statement, which heavily revised what he had told lawmakers in closed-door testimony on Oct. 17. 'Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret.'Sondland's appearance Wednesday also confirmed testimony by several other witnesses that $391 million in congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine was being blocked by the White House until the new Ukrainian president announced investigations into two matters: alleged corruption by the Democrat Trump most feared in 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden, and a debunked conspiracy theory falsely claiming that Russia had not helped Trump win the 2016 election but that Ukrainian officials had planted false evidence implicating Russia.All this material will likely make it more difficult for Trump's defenders in the Senate, should there eventually be a trial on impeachment charges, to argue that Trump did not withhold official benefits to Ukraine in return for politically useful favors to himself, former prosecutors said.'His best remaining argument is that what he did was wrongful but should not result in his removal from office,' said Renato Mariotti, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago.The White House has struggled to settle on a coherent defense of Trump's actions, at first arguing that the impeachment process itself was flawed and therefore unfair to Trump. Then, the main thrust became that Trump has a legitimate interest in ensuring that U.S. taxpayer money is not wasted in countries with rampant corruption <U+2015> but that was undermined by the lack of any record of Trump criticizing corruption in instances other than the allegations about Biden's son's work with a Ukrainian natural gas company.This could leave the White House pushing the most basic argument: that Trump as president has broad authority to set foreign policy, even if it benefits him personally. This argument has been made by outside White House allies as well as Republicans on Capitol Hill. 'The president can meet with whoever he wants to meet for good reason or no reason at all,' said Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn.One White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Trump has been denied the opportunity to participate in the proceedings. 'We don't have to accept as compelling evidence testimony from any witness we haven't been able to cross-examine. The president has been denied all levels of due process,' the official said.On Wednesday, despite all the witness testimony to the contrary, Trump personally continued repeating his claim that he did not try to coerce Ukraine to help him damage Biden. He read from handwritten notes before boarding a helicopter, repeating what he said he'd told Sondland in a September phone call: ''I want nothing.'I want nothing.'I want no quid pro quo.'Tell Zelensky' <U+2015> President Zelensky <U+2015> 'to do the right thing.' So here's my answer: 'I want nothing.'I want nothing.'I want no quid pro quo.''Republicans in the impeachment hearing, meanwhile, continued to make a separate argument <U+2015> that the entire question is moot because the aid was ultimately delivered.'The fact is the aid was given to Ukraine without any announcement of new investigations,' said Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York.'They got the money, they got the money. God bless America, it all worked out, right?' added Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said their argument made no sense, given that the military aid was only released after the White House learned that a whistleblower complaint on the matter was about to make its way to Congress, despite White House attempts to block it.'Getting caught is no defense,' said Schiff.Danya Perry, a former federal prosecutor in New York City, said the Republicans' related argument that Trump could not have committed bribery or extortion because he never used those words is similarly nonsensical.'If a mobster, caught in the act of kneecapping a victim, were to tell the cops: 'I am definitely not committing an extortive act under Title 18, United States Code, section 1951,' it likely would not be an overly persuasive line of defense,' she said.HuffPost reporter Igor Bobic contributed to this report.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

It Opened In 2013.","President Donald Trump traveled to Austin, Texas, on Wednesday to tour a manufacturing plant with Apple chief executive Tim Cook, touting what he called a 'new' facility that would bring high-paying jobs back to America.The only problem? The plant has been making Apple computers since 2013, long before Trump was elected.The president toured a facility run by an independent company called Flex Ltd. that assembles Apple's expensive Mac Pro computers. During the tour, Trump suggested that his efforts to convince companies to relocate their manufacturing facilities back to the U.S. ' and in particular,'his relationship with Cook over the past few years ' had paid off.'We're seeing the beginning of a very powerful and important plant,' said Trump, who has long boasted about his efforts to convince manufacturers to come back to America. 'Anybody that followed my campaign, I would always talk about Apple, that I want to see Apple building plants in the United States. And that's what's happening.'But that assertion is not true, and Cook did not correct Trump after he made the statements.President Trump just toured a Texas plant that has been making Apple computers since 2013 and took credit for it, suggesting the plant opened today. ""Today is a very special day."" Tim Cook spoke immediately after him and did not correct the record.I don't know why @tim_cook didn't correct the president.I do know that Apple assembles most of its products in China, making many potentially subject to tariffs.I also know @tim_cook wants tariff waivers. When asked today about it, Mr. Trump said: 'We'll look into that.'The New York Times' Jack Nicas noted shortly after the event that Apple has not, in fact, built any new plants in the U.S. since Trump's election and that the vast majority of its products are still made overseas.The tech giant did release more details about its previously announced'$1 billion campus in Austin that will house 5,000 white-collar employees beginning in 2022. But those roles will, by and large, not be manufacturing jobs.'With the construction of our new campus in Austin now underway, Apple is deepening our close bond with the city and the talented and diverse workforce that calls it home,' Cook said in a company statement.Trump repeated his falsehood on Twitter later in the day, saying, 'Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America.' He also shared a video of his tour of the plant.Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America. Today Nancy Pelosi closed Congress because she doesn't care about American Workers!Trump commended Apple for building the Mac Pro in the U.S. on Wednesday, saying that by doing so, Cook didn't 'have to worry about tariffs' that would affect the cost of the final product.That's also false. The Verge notes that some Mac Pro parts are imported from China, and Apple has to pay tariffs on them before the devices are assembled in Texas. A new round of tariffs is set to go into effect on Dec. 15, and it will potentially affect the cost of a bevy of Apple products, including iPhones.Apple was flirting with the idea of moving production overseas earlier this year to lower the costs of the Mac Pro but said in September that the latest iteration of the computer would be assembled in Austin after all.The president also tweeted another confusing lie on Wednesday, saying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had 'closed Congress' on Wednesday, apparently pointing to the ongoing impeachment investigation into the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine.Congress was not closed.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), for example, deftly tied the hearings to her recently released plan to tackle corruption.''He wrote a check for a million dollars and that tells us what is happening in Washington... We are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder,' Warren said, referring to bombshell testimony from Trump donor turned European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland'earlier in the day.Sondland, who was appointed in 2017 after donating $1 million to Trump's inauguration,'delivered devastating testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday morning that implicated Trump and a number of top administration officials in what he acknowledged was a 'clear quid pro quo' scheme to exchange official acts for millions of dollars in U.S. government funds.South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said Democrats need to move forward with the impeachment inquiry, but he also said they must be ready to bring the country together after Trump's presidency.'We must confront Donald Trump for his wrongdoings. That means impeachment. But we must do more. I'm running to be the president who will stand amid the rubble of his presidency, pick up the pieces, and unify a divided nation,' Buttigieg said.He continued on that theme by noting that each Democratic presidential candidate is 'running to be the president for that day the sun comes up and the Trump presidency is behind us, which will be a tender moment in the life of this country.'Former Vice President Joe Biden used the moment to tout his strength among people who view him as most able to beat Trump in 2020.'Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee, that's pretty clear,' Biden said, referring to Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate his family. He added that Russian President Vladimir Putin also 'doesn't want me to be president.'Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) tied impeachment hearings to her 'justice' campaign platform and her biography as a former prosecutor in California.'We have a criminal living in the White House,' Harris said, before taking a swipe at Buttigieg, over his 'tender moment' comment seconds earlier. 'Until we get to that tender moment, justice is on the ballot.''Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), meanwhile, argued that Trump's presidency is putting democracy at risk.''This is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with Ukraine, but every step of the way puts his own private interests, his own partisan interests, his own political interests, in front of our country's interests, and this is wrong. This is a pattern with this man,' Klobuchar said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here's how.",2019-11-20 22:06:15
"225",1450468198,"Donald Trump And Impeachment Cast Shadow Over Democratic Presidential Debate","Democratic presidential candidates have tried to avoid dwelling on President Donald Trump and the impeachment process on the campaign trail <U+2015> and voters in the early primary and caucus states have largely obliged them.But on Wednesday night, the president, the scandal rapidly engulfing his administration and the effect he has had on the country's political culture exerted influence on the fifth Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta.'More than in previous debates, the moderators <U+2015> from MSNBC and The Washington Post <U+2015> pushed the candidates back, time and again, to the matter of how to handle Trump and the aftermath of his presidency. And the candidates, prepared as they were to stress their preferred policy issues, found creative ways to bring the conversation back to their core message.Sen. Elizabeth Warren's response to the first debate question about how she would cajole her Republican colleagues into throwing Trump out of office in an impeachment trial in the Senate was a case in point. After dispensing with the question quickly <U+2015> she would recommend that they read special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's conduct <U+2015> Warren pivoted to her anti-corruption message.'The senator from Massachusetts noted that the Trump administration's European Union ambassador, Gordon Sondland, whose explosive testimony in the House on Wednesday prompted discussion of impeachment, had received his post because he donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration.Warren reminded the audience that she has promised not to grant diplomatic posts to campaign donors and invited her fellow candidates to make that promise as well.'I asked everyone who's running for president to join me in that, and not a single person has so far,' she declared. 'I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say we are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder.''Other candidates, such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, relished the opportunity to wax lyrical about the grand stakes of holding Trump accountable.'What this impeachment proceeding about is really our democracy at stake,' Klobuchar said. 'This is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with Ukraine but every step of the way puts his own private interests, his own partisan interests, his own political interests in front of our country's interest, and this is wrong.'After the exchange on impeachment, Trump reappeared in the debate several minutes later in the form of a discussion about polarization.Asked whether it was appropriate for supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to chant 'Lock him up' about Trump at his rallies, Sanders declined to condemn such conduct.'The people of this country are catching on to the degree that this president thinks he is above the law,' Sanders said.' 'And what the American people are saying, 'Nobody is above the law.''Former Vice President Joe Biden would not say if, once Trump is out of office, he would prosecute the former president or decline to do so to avoid reigniting the country's partisan tensions. He insisted that it would be up to his Department of Justice, which would function independently.But, in keeping with his self-styled image as a healer and unifier, Biden condemned, unprompted, the chants of 'Lock him up' heard at Sanders rallies.''Look, we have to bring this country together. Let's start talking civilly to people,' Biden said.Thanks in part to the moderators' crisp, personalized questions and balanced form of skepticism, the debate featured far fewer fireworks among the four poll leaders <U+2015> Warren, Sanders, Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg <U+2015> than previous rumbles.Warren, who has struggled for weeks to shake off questions about the evolving details of her 'Medicare for All' plan, got a chance to refocus the discussion on what she sees as the benefits of it. And both Biden and Buttigieg made their case that her plan would be too coercive and unrealistic. But, unlike in previous debates, the exchange did not last more than a few minutes and did not devolve into an extended back and forth.Instead, candidates got the chance to discuss a number of other kitchen-table economic issues that had received shorter shrift in previous forums, including paid family leave, child care and housing.Warren, whose sweet spot is precisely in these areas, got the chance to discuss her wealth tax at length and how it would generate revenue for universal child care and preschool.'I'm tired of freeloading billionaires. I think it's time that we ask those at the very top to pay more so that every single one of our children gets more,' she declared.The fast-moving yet substance-heavy format was particularly forgiving for candidates whose low standing in the polls gave them something extra to prove on Wednesday night.Sen. Kamala Harris of California got the chance to discuss her paid family leave plan, which she said was tailored to accommodate parents who have children later in life. The six-month duration of her new benefit, she said, is deliberately generous to account for the fact that parents of young children in their 30s and 40s may also be caring for their aging parents, and that this dual obligation falls disproportionately on women.'Many women are having to make a very difficult choice: whether they're going to leave a profession for which they have a passion to care for their family, or whether they are going to give up a paycheck that is part of what that family relies on,' she said.Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, one of four candidates onstage Wednesday who has yet to qualify for the next debate in December, came in determined to make a splash. Although in previous showdowns he has stuck to a kind of Goldilocks liberalism somewhere to the left of Biden and to the right of Warren and Sanders, Booker leaned into the business-friendly inclinations that defined the earlier stages of his career.He cut Warren off during a discussion of her wealth tax, calling it 'cumbersome' and insisting the country could raise revenue from the wealthy through other means. He also faulted Democrats for failing to adequately encourage entrepreneurship in favor of seeking to cut the superrich down to size.'We as Democrats have got to start talking not just about how we tax from a stage but how we grow wealth in this country amongst those disadvantaged communities that are not seeing it,' he said.His most memorable moment, though, was a progressive one: when he pressed Biden to account for his opposition to marijuana legalization, which Booker said disproportionately harms African Americans. Biden said on Saturday that he would allow states to proceed with legalization experiments but would refrain from legalizing it federally because of his concern that it is a 'gateway drug' to the use of more serious substances.'I thought you might have been high when you said it,' Booker joked.' 'Marijuana, in our country, is already legal for privileged people.'But it was Biden's meandering response, defending his credibility on racial justice by pointing to the depth of his support among Black voters, that proved the most startling element of the exchange. Biden noted that former Sen. Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois has endorsed him but incorrectly called her the 'only' Black woman to serve in the Senate. (She was the first, but not the only one.)Booker and Harris interjected. 'The other one is here,' Harris said with a chuckle, referring to herself.In the end, though, the conversation invariably turned back to Trump, who has become something of a lens through which Democratic presidential hopefuls articulate their theories for effecting positive change.Warren and Sanders diagnose Trump as a symptom of underlying public disenchantment with a corrupt, rigged political system and economy, and promise to bring a fighting spirit and grassroots movement to bear on the ossified levers of power so government can work again for ordinary people. They see unity as the byproduct of this progress, which is likely to be more painful still, rather than a precursor.'If you want to be part of a movement that is not only going to beat Trump but transform America, that doesn't have a super PAC, doesn't do fundraisers at wealthy people's homes, please join us at BernieSanders.com,' Sanders said in his concluding remarks.Biden, Buttigieg and Booker, by contrast, see their roles as calming agents whose first order of business would be easing the national acrimony that has escalated under Trump.'Buttigieg, who spoke about the need for a president capable of unifying the country when the 'sun comes up' and Trump is not president anymore, has been vague about how exactly he plans to overcome the combined forces of entrenched Republican opposition <U+2015> even if then the Senate is narrowly controlled by Democrats <U+2015> and the deep-pocketed resistance of corporate special interests to top Democratic priorities.He did not get any more specific on Wednesday night, falling back instead on his claim that 'we are now in a different reality than we were even 12 years ago,' shortly before former President Barack Obama took office.'There is an American majority that stands ready to tackle big issues that didn't exist in the same way, even a few years ago,' he said, while neglecting to note that bills that poll well routinely die in today's hyper-partisan, special interest-infested Congress.But for perhaps the first time in any of the debates, the moderators pressed Biden to explain why exactly he expects Republican lawmakers, who continue to resist holding Trump accountable, to treat him any differently than they treated Obama.Biden responded by suggesting that he is the candidate best poised to create coattails for maintaining the Democratic majority in the House and regaining one in the Senate. 'You have to ask yourself up here: Who is most likely to be able to win the nomination in the first place, to win the presidency in the first place?' he said. 'And, secondly, who is most likely to increase the number of people who are Democrats in the House and in the Senate?'This article has been updated throughout with more comments during the debate.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"226",1450536293,"5 Takeaways From The Democratic Debate","Wednesday's debate among 10 of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates was remarkably civil compared with last month's debate. The candidates were reluctant to attack, and both a plateauing Sen. Elizabeth Warren and a rising South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg largely skating through the two hours. Instead, the candidates mostly focused their fire on President Donald Trump just hours after damning impeachment testimony.The debate in Atlanta was not without its clashes <U+2015> Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii battled with both Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Buttigieg, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey attacked former Vice President Joe Biden over marijuana legalization <U+2015> but it seems unlikely to dramatically shake up the field.Here are five things you should take away from the fifth Democratic presidential debate.Folks, let's be clear: Biden's gaffes, so far, have not had a significant effect on his front-runner status. But his exchange with Booker over marijuana legalization was another example of Biden slipping up late in a debate night, and any mistake that poses a threat to Biden's massive lead among Black voters is a bad one.Booker attacked Biden for reiterating his opposition to marijuana legislation and suggesting that weed could be a 'gateway drug.' Booker joked that the former vice president was 'high when he said it.' Biden responded by noting he supported the decriminalization of marijuana and then slipped up when he was explaining how he 'came out of the Black community in terms of my support.'Biden said he had the support of the 'only African American woman elected to the United States Senate,' referring to former Sen. Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois. The problem? Harris, a black woman currently serving in the Senate, was standing feet away. Booker and Harris quickly corrected him, and Harris began laughing.'The other one is here,' Harris said, before Biden corrected himself.If the moment was bad for Biden, it was a plus for Booker, who should get increased attention by making news on a social issue the media loves to cover. After the debate, campaign aides said he raised more than $200,000 in just 30 minutes.Update: we raised more in the the 11pm HOUR than our the previous best online fundraising DAY in this campaign. https://t.co/tooEazXZjsThe run-up to the debate made it appear as if Buttigieg could be the target of attacks from Warren, Booker, Harris, Klobuchar and other candidates. Instead, he largely escaped unscathed. Harris and Klobuchar declined to repeat earlier critiques of the lightly experienced candidate. The one direct attack came from Gabbard on foreign policy <U+2015> something that is unlikely to keep Buttigieg's staffers up at night.Still, Harris and Booker repeatedly emphasized a candidate needed to re-create the 'Obama coalition,' which could be a subtle way of reminding voters and donors about Buttigieg's lack of support from people of color, which is crucial to winning both the general election and the Democratic primary. (That lack of support also explains why Biden, who has aggressively attacked both Warren and Sanders in the past, might not view Buttigieg as a direct threat just yet.)Warren received the first question of the debate about impeachment and immediately used it to pivot to her core message: corruption in Washington, D.C. She noted that Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, whose testimony earlier in the day was devastating for the Trump administration, got his job after donating $1 million to Trump's inauguration.'And that tells us about what's happening in Washington, the corruption, how money buys its way into Washington,' she said, before challenging the other candidates to promise not to give ambassadorships as favors to campaign donors.The answer was the start of a solid but unspectacular night for Warren, whose poll numbers have deflated over the past month. Though she struggled to answer questions about the cost of 'Medicare for All' in the last debate, she was able to clearly articulate her plan's benefits during the early portion of Wednesday's exchanges, noting she would push to lower the cost of prescription drugs and would quickly expand Medicare coverage to 135 million people. And she was able to repeatedly focus on her core campaign theme of fighting corruption.Warren did have one missed opportunity. During a polite disagreement with Booker over her proposed wealth tax, he suggested that the senator from Massachusetts needed more of a focus on helping Americans create wealth and supporting entrepreneurship. Warren could have responded by noting that free child care coverage and the elimination of student loan debt would allow Americans to start more businesses and take more risks. Instead, she repeated her talking points.Harris skyrocketed in the polls after she attacked Biden over race during the first round of presidential debates. But soon after, she began a slow and steady decline in the polls. Lately, she's been in the news more for her campaign struggles <U+2015> she laid off staffers earlier this month <U+2015> than for big moments.On Wednesday night, she played a fairly significant role in the debate. Early on, she clashed with Gabbard over foreign policy, effectively articulating the mainstream Democratic case against the Hawaiian. She later declined to repeat earlier criticism of Buttigieg on race but still used the answer to make the case for Democrats to nominate a Black woman against Trump.'The question has to be: Where you been? And what are you going to do? And do you understand who the people are?' Harris said after ticking off statistics about how Black women are more likely to die in childbirth and to earn 61 cents for every dollar a man makes. 'We've got to re-create the Obama coalition to win.'And her laugh after Biden's mistaken assertion was the moment most likely to become a meme, for what that's worth.'Both Buttigieg and Harris eagerly took on Gabbard, the field's resident anti-interventionist, internal party critic and general gadfly. Their showdowns with Gabbard were the second- and third-most tweeted moments of the night, according to Twitter, trailing Booker and Biden's showdown over marijuana legalization.'I think that it's unfortunate that we have someone on this stage that is attempting to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States who, during the Obama administration, spent four years full time on Fox News criticizing President Obama,' Harris said, adding that Gabbard 'palled around with Steve Bannon.'Though the candidates were generally reluctant to attack each other for fear of alienating potential supporters in a crowded field, that rule likely doesn't apply to Gabbard. Polling often shows Democrats are more likely to have a negative view of Gabbard than a positive one.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here's how.",2019-11-21 01:49:37

"231",1451018942,"Democratic Candidates Not Ready To Say Donors Can’t Be Ambassadors","ATLANTA <U+2015> One of the officials at the center of the House impeachment investigation is Gordon Sondland, a man with no diplomatic experience who paid $1 million to Donald Trump's inaugural committee and was rewarded with the title of U.S. ambassador to the European Union.'He's part of a long, bipartisan pay-for-play system in which ambassadorships are handed out to a president's biggest donors who are eager for a spot on the world stage. (Sondland was confirmed without objection from the Senate in June 2018.)Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has pledged to break this tradition. Some of the other Democratic presidential candidates, however, aren't quite ready to follow suit.''I'll certainly commit that anybody I appoint to any position will be qualified and somebody who will do a good job serving the United States,' Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said Thursday.'Buttigieg has relied heavily on wealthy donors and big fundraisers, unlike Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who have sworn off those types of events.'Warren reiterated her commitment to not giving out ambassadorships as rewards for big donations during the debate Wednesday night.'Anyone who gives a big donation, don't ask to be an ambassador,' she said. 'I ask everyone running for president to join me in that.'Her campaign released a digital ad on Thursday that made the same point.'Ambassador Gordon Sondland got his job after writing a $1 million check to Donald Trump's inaugural committee. This is Washington corruption at its worst. I've pledged never to give ambassadorial positions to wealthy donors'and every candidate should do the same. pic.twitter.com/kXG6jAJ34KSome candidates have stepped up to the challenge. Sanders said in a tweet Thursday that it's 'an outrage that throughout the history of this country, presidential administrations have been filled with wealthy campaign contributors.''I will fill my administration with my donors <U+2015> the working class of this country who give an average of $18 a piece,' he wrote.A day earlier, his campaign co-chair Nina Turner told HuffPost that the pledge is irrelevant for Sanders anyway.'He's the only candidate up there that doesn't have to pledge that because he doesn't take money from multimillionaires and billionaires so they can't buy it,''she said. 'His donors are the people. His donors are teachers and nurses and Walmart workers.'It is an outrage that throughout the history of this country, presidential administrations have been filled with wealthy campaign contributors.Here's my commitment: I will fill my administration with my donors'the working class of this country who give an average of $18 apiece. https://t.co/BMcSdEk5RhAnother Democratic presidential contender, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli'n Castro, released a statement Thursday stating his support for Warren's pledge.'If we're serious about reforming our democracy and taking money out of politics, it means eliminating the pay-to-play practices that have dominated diplomatic appointments in both parties,' Castro said in his statement.'In my administration, only the most-qualified people will be considered for ambassadorships and appointments ' not wealthy donors or big bundlers,' he added.Buttigieg's campaign pushed back on Warren's pledge after the debate, telling HuffPost that being a big donor shouldn't disqualify someone from an ambassadorship.Hasoni Pratts, the national engagement director for Buttigieg's campaign, pointed to Caroline Kennedy ' the daughter of President John F. Kennedy and a former U.S. ambassador to Japan ' as an example of a wealthy person who excelled in her role.'She has been a big donor all her life,' Pratts said. 'Would you say that she should not be an ambassador?'Pratts then essentially said that banning wealthy donors from getting ambassadorships would be discrimination.''I don't think they should discriminate because of one particular thing,' Pratts said. 'I will tell you that I don't think Mayor Pete has a specific criteria except for the best person for the job.'Stephanie Morales, the elected commonwealth's attorney in Portsmouth, Virginia, and a surrogate at the debate for Sen.

"232",1451018878,"New Call Details, Holmes Testifies He’s ‘Never Seen Anything Like This’","David Holmes had 'never seen anything like' it.Holmes, a State Department official with the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine,'shared new details on Thursday about the phone conversation between President Donald Trump and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland that he overheard this summer at a restaurant in Kyiv.'This was a very distinctive experience,' Holmes told House investigators conducting the impeachment hearing, explaining how the moment stood out against the backdrop of his foreign service career. He recounted the July 26 episode, in which he was seated directly across the table from Sondland on an outdoor terrace with two other aides.His testimony fleshed out a clearer picture of Trump's dealings with Ukraine, which kicked off the impeachment inquiry back in September.'Someone at a lunch in a restaurant making a call on a cellphone to the president of the United States, being able to hear his voice, his very distinctive personality ' we've all seen him on television,' Holmes said.Holmes was able to hear much of the discussion simply because Trump's voice was very loud, he said in his prepared remarks, confirming a previously reported detail. He said Sondland 'held the phone away from his ear for a period of time, presumably because of the loud volume.'Trump, meanwhile, tweeted that he has 'never' been able to hear a conversation not set to speakerphone, boasting that his hearing is 'great.'At the restaurant, Sondland told the president that he was calling from Kyiv, at which point the president 'clarif[ied]' that Sondland was calling from Ukraine, according to Holmes. (Kyiv is the capital city of Ukraine.)The ambassador then told Trump that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky 'loves your ass,' Holmes said. (The remarks use an alternate spelling of Zelensky's name.)Holmes continued:I then heard President Trump ask, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?'Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he's gonna do it,' adding that President Zelenskyy will do 'anything you ask him to.'Even though I did not take notes of these statements, I have a clear recollection that these statements were made.What Holmes heard stood out to him because of its relevance to his work. Just one day earlier, on July 25, Trump had asked Zelensky to 'do us a favor' and look into the conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 election for the benefit of Hillary Clinton, not Trump. He also asked Zelensky to investigate Burisma, an energy company that once had Joe Biden's son Hunter as a board member. Trump appeared to believe that the Bidens were involved in corruption in Ukraine <U+2015> and that an investigation announcement would hurt Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign.Although Holmes did not read a transcript of the July 25 call until its public release in September, he had been hearing about the proposed investigations. For one, Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani had brought up the conspiracy theories on national television several times over the previous months.'[Sondland and Trump] were directly addressing something I had been wondering about, working on, for weeks and even months. A topic that had led to the recall of my former boss, the former ambassador,' Holmes said, referring to former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was abruptly fired earlier this year.'Yovanovitch said in public testimony last week that she believed she was fired for pushing back on the Trump administration's efforts to launch an investigation into the Bidens in Ukraine.Holmes: ""This was a very distinctive experience.

'You can tell the Kardashians you tried,' Sondland added, according to Holmes.After the call ended, Sondland told Holmes that Trump had been in a 'bad mood,' as was 'often the case early in the morning.'He went on to testify that Sondland agreed Trump did not 'give an expletive' about Ukraine.'I asked why not,' Holmes said, 'and Ambassador Sondland stated that the President only cares about 'big stuff.' I noted that there was 'big stuff' going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia, and Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant 'big stuff' that benefits the President, like the 'Biden investigation' that Mr. Giuliani was pushing.'Holmes' testimony <U+2015> concurrent with National Security Council adviser Fiona Hill's <U+2015> is scheduled to be the last given this week in the impeachment inquiry, following public hearings with a number of other high-level officials.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"233",1451018866,"Holmes Outlines Corruption, Hypocrisy Of Trump’s Ukraine Shakedown","WASHINGTON <U+2015> The career foreign service official who overheard President Donald Trump speaking with his donor-turned-ambassador about investigations that would benefit Trump's political campaign said Thursday that the Trump administration's effort to pull the Ukrainian government into American politics made United States government officials look like hypocrites.'David Holmes, testifying before the House Intelligence Committee, pointed out the irony in the U.S. government pushing the Ukrainians to operate with integrity while the president of the United States and his personal attorney pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to take actions to damage former Vice President Joe Biden, who Trump considered his chief political rival.'While we had advised our Ukrainian counterparts to voice a commitment to following the rule of law and generally investigating credible corruption allegations, this was a demand that President Zelensky personally commit, on a cable news channel, to a specific investigation of President Trump's political rival,' Holmes testified Thursday.'They can recognize hypocrisy when they see it?' House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) asked Thursday.'It's hard to explain why we would do that,' said Holmes.'It was Holmes who recalled hearing a phone call between Trump and Gordon Sondland, the Trump donor turned diplomat who others placed at the center of the impeachment scandal. This conversation came a day after Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky, in which Trump pressed his counterpart to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of Trump's 2020 presidential rival.'Holmes told impeachment investigators on Thursday that Trump was talking so loudly on the call that Sondland had to hold the phone away from his ear. During the conversation, which took place at a restaurant in Ukraine, according to Holmes, Sondland told Trump that Zelensky 'loves your ass,' and the U.S. president responded, 'So, he's going to do the investigation?''He's going to do it,' Sondland responded, according to Holmes.The phone call is yet more evidence that Trump was directly involved in pressuring the Ukrainian government to open investigations into the Bidens. During Wednesday's impeachment hearing, Sondland said that 'we followed the president's orders' on Ukraine.Trump reacted in real time on Thursday morning as Holmes delivered a lengthy opening statement on Capitol Hill. The president argued on Twitter that it would be difficult to overhear a conversation while someone was not on speakerphone, at least from his personal experience.'Never have I been watching a person making a call, which was not on speakerphone, and been able to hear or understand a conversation. I've even tried, but to no avail,' 73-year-old Trump, who is known for talking loudly, wrote in a tweet, urging his followers to try for themselves.Holmes, meanwhile, testified that it was difficult to forget such a 'distinctive experience.''I've never seen anything like this in my foreign service career,' he said Thursday, referring to hearing the president's conversation with Sondland. 'Very colorful language was used. They were directly addressing something I had been working on for weeks, months.'Sondland did not recall the details of the conversation when asked about it on Wednesday, but he also didn't dispute Holmes' account. When asked about the 'loves your ass' remark recalled by Holmes, Sondland said it sounded 'like something I would say... That's how President Trump and I communicate ' a lot of four-letter words.'''In her testimony before the committee, former Senior Director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council Fiona'Hill asserted that any talk that Russia did not target the U.S. during the 2016 elections 'is a fictional narrative' promoted by Russian forces. Trump and his Republican defenders have repeatedly pushed the baseless theory that Ukraine was to blame instead.Thursday's proceedings capped off the second week of public impeachment hearings that featured bombshell testimony from nine witnesses who shed new light on Trump's attempted quid pro quo with Ukraine. Their accounts dismantled nearly every argument Republicans had mounted in defense of the president, implicating him and other senior Trump administration officials in the scheme. Despite this, Trump and GOP lawmakers continue to insist the president did nothing wrong by seeking dirt on a political rival by holding up financial assistance to Ukraine.The impeachment inquiry is expected to pause next week as Congress leaves town for the Thanksgiving holiday, and pick up again next month in the House Judiciary Committee.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"234",1451018853,"Hill Shoots Down GOP Conspiracy Theories, Says ‘Our Nation Is Being Torn Apart’","Fiona Hill, the former top National Security Council official for Europe and Russia under President Donald Trump, warned the House Intelligence Committee against spreading what she called false conspiracy theories that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election during her impeachment inquiry testimony on Thursday.'Some of you on this committee appear to believe Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country ' and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,' Hill said.Committee Republicans have endorsed numerous unfounded theories that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. Specifically, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) has suggested that the 'black ledger' that revealed millions in hidden payments by the government of deposed President Viktor Yanukovych to Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort is a potential forgery.'Trump has also endorsed conspiracy theories that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the Democratic National Committee servers and is presently hiding the server in Ukraine.'These theories have all been disproven and Manafort was convicted in federal court of receiving illicit payments from Ukraine.On the July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asked Zelensky to 'find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike,' referencing the private firm that investigated the DNC hack. Trump incorrectly claimed that CrowdStrike was funded by Ukrainian oligarchs and that the DNC server was in Ukraine. 'The server, they say Ukraine has it,' Trump said.Hill described the theories pushed by committee Republicans as a 'fictional narrative' that aims to implicate Ukraine and not Russia as the country that interfered in the 2016 election. She added that these disproven theories Trump floated to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the July 25 call were false.'Our nation is being torn apart,' Hill said. 'Truth is questioned. Our highly professional, expert career foreign service is being undermined.'The conspiracy theories endorsed by Trump and committee Republicans are designed to muddy the waters about Russian interference in the 2016 election. Hill said that the Russian government supports these theories and that they have gained traction in some quarters of the U.S. independent of that support.

But had former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was the target of said interference campaign, won the election, Hill noted, 'She too would have had major questions about her legitimacy.'Hill noted that representatives of other countries, including perhaps Ukraine, may have 'had harsh words for candidates' in 2016, but these statements did not add up to a concerted campaign to influence the outcome of the election.'I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U.S. adversary, and that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked us in 2016,' Hill said.

"235",1451100617,"Testimony Shows The Harsh Truth About Angry Women","Fiona Hill, the former top National Security Council official for Europe and Russia under President Donald Trump, shed light on a harsh truth during her testimony Thursday: People don't take angry women seriously.Hill, the latest ex-member of Trump's NSC to testify at the House's impeachment inquiry hearings, made the remarks when Republican counsel Steve Castor asked her about comments made by Gordon Sondland, the Republican donor turned European Union ambassador whose role in shaping Trump's Ukraine policy has become the center of the hearings.'He indicated you were upset and you were upset with [former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton] and upset with the way things were going, and I believe your counsel said that was an outright fabrication,' Castor said to Hill.In reality, Hill responded, she was angry with Sondland for breaking protocol around diplomatic policymaking and using a back channel to coordinate with Ukraine.'I had a bit of a blowup with Ambassador Sondland, and I had a couple of testy encounters with him,' Hill said. 'One of those was in June '18 when I actually said to him, 'Who put you in charge of Ukraine?' I'll admit I was a bit rude, but that's when he told me the president, which shut me up.'Her experience trying to stop Sondland from straying into 'personal politics' and keeping meetings secret and instead coordinate with the NSC, Hill said, is familiar to most women.''I was actually, to be honest, angry with him,' she said. 'And you know, I hate to say it, but often when women show anger it's not fully appreciated. It's often pushed onto emotional issues, perhaps, or deflected onto other people.'Research supports Hill's remarks. A 2015 study by researchers at Arizona State University found that while people reward angry men and question their own opinions when faced with them, they punish angry women and may go as far as to form opposite opinions to them.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly quoted Hill as saying Sondland told her 'the president would 'shut me up.'' The error was due to HuffPost staff mishearing one of Hill's words. The correct statement from Hill is that Sondland told her he was acting on the president's orders, 'which shut me up,' she said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

That was a view shared by the Obama administration and key European allies.Nevertheless, Graham made a tenuous connection between Hunter Biden and Ukrainian corruption in his letter. On the same day in 2016 that Ukrainian officials raided the home of Burisma's founder, Graham wrote,'Hunter Biden began following a State Department official on Twitter. Graham suggested that fact indicated that 'the two may have initiated conversations regarding Prosecutor General [Viktor] Shokin's investigation into Burisma.' The date was Feb. 4, 2016.'In the weeks afterward, Graham wrote, Joe Biden held several phone conversations with then-President Poroshenko to discuss removing Shokin over allegations that he himself was corrupt. The prosecutor was removed on March 29, 2016.'Graham's request covers communications between the parties from the day Hunter Biden followed then-Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken on Twitter to the day of Shokin's ouster.The senator did not specify a deadline for the materials' delivery.In the ongoing impeachment inquiry, witnesses have bolstered allegations that Trump leveraged military aid and a coveted White House meeting to improperly pressure the current Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens.Joe Biden is among the many Democrats seeking to take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election and several national polls have consistently shown Biden leading the president in hypothetical match-ups.Language has been adjusted to clarify allegations relating to Victor Shokin.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"238",1451223406,"Why Should Anyone Believe Gordon Sondland Didn’t Connect Burisma To Biden?","The second week of House impeachment hearings featured top diplomats and White House officials giving dramatic testimony about President Donald Trump's effort to coerce Ukraine's government into launching investigations that would damage political rival and 2020 candidate Joe Biden.But several key officials also gave contradictory or inconsistent accounts of events and their knowledge of the quid pro quo campaign, sometimes radically departing from their initial closed-door testimonies in what appeared to be attempts to limit their accountability in the scandal.United States Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's testimony, for instance, was damning and implicated top Trump administration officials, but it was also self-serving with many glaring omissions. Sondland tried to maintain a veneer of innocence throughout the hearing, claiming that he acted in good faith at all times and didn't know Trump's push to investigate Ukrainian gas company Burisma had anything to do with Biden. (Biden's son, Hunter, served on the board of Burisma.)House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) was incredulous that Sondland, who has previously claimed Ukraine was an important part of his portfolio, had no idea about Burisma and the Bidens <U+2015> especially given that Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was publicly advocating for an investigation into the company.'Apparently, a lot of people did not make the connection,' Sondland claimed.Former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker gave a similar excuse for not raising concerns about the quid pro quo effort toward Ukraine, claiming that he didn't know that Burisma was tied to Biden and saying he only found out about it in late September.'I did not understand that others believed that any investigation of the Ukrainian company, Burisma, which had a history of accusations of corruption, was tantamount to investigating Vice President Biden. I drew a distinction between the two,' Volker said, claiming that in hindsight he should have made the connection.Former National Security Council aide Tim Morrison, too, claimed he had to Google what Burisma was due to his unfamiliarity with the company.But Morrison, Sondland and Volker's denials are questionable given that Giuliani's interest in Burisma and its link to Biden was front-page news in The New York Times as early as May 1, and for months Giuliani was openly calling on Ukraine to launch investigations that would damage Biden. The effort to pressure Ukraine over Burisma had been covered by numerous major media outlets, and had been floating around as a conservative talking point since at least early 2019.Sondland claiming he did not connect Biden to Burisma wasn't the only time his account appeared to downplay his involvement in the quid pro quo effort, as he also contradicted other officials' testimony regarding a July 10 meeting with Ukrainian officials at the White House. Sondland testified that his recollection of the meeting did not square with accounts from officials including Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and former top National Security Council official for Europe and Russia Fiona Hill. Both stated that Sondland had talked about investigations with Ukrainian officials during the meeting, and Hill added that it was not credible Sondland could have been oblivious that investigating Burisma was essentially code for the Bidens.Hill testified again on Thursday that Ukrainian officials brought up their desire for a White House visit during a July 10 meeting. As national security adviser John Bolton tried to deflect from answering the Ukrainians, Sondland interjected with a reference to the quid pro quo arrangement.'Ambassador Sondland leaned in, basically to say, 'Well we have an agreement that there will be a meeting if specific investigations are put underway,'' Hill said. 'That's when I saw Ambassador Bolton stiffen.'Hill testified that Bolton then immediately excused himself from the meeting. Bolton later instructed Hill to go to the National Security Council's top lawyer John Eisenberg and tell him that Bolton was not involved in 'whatever drug deal Sondland and [White House Chief of Staff Mick] Mulvaney are cooking up.' Hill took the 'drug deal' to mean the exchange of investigations targeting Biden in exchange for a meeting with Trump.The July 10 meeting was an early source of discrepancies in the investigation, and Volker initially denied in his closed-door testimony last month that Sondland raised investigations in the July 10 meeting. But Volker changed his account this week after witnesses such as Hill brought up the meeting and evidence mounted that Volker, Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry were part of a back channel to Ukraine that pushed for a quid pro quo.'The meeting was essentially over when Ambassador Sondland made a general comment about investigations. I think all of us thought it was inappropriate,' Volker said in his opening statement.'We asked you about that meeting during your deposition and you told us nothing about this,' Schiff asked Volker later in the hearing.

'He recommended that the president 'wait until after the sentencing or it will make it worse,' adding that the president should 'let him get sentenced, play the racism card, give him a ticker-tape when he comes home.''Holmes then said that Sondland advised Trump that Sweden 'should have released him on your word,' but that 'you can tell the Kardashians that you tried.'Kim Kardashian and Kanye West had lobbied for A$AP Rocky's release when he was jailed, and Kardashian thanked the president'when the rapper was released.Holmes also testified that when diplomats were unable to orchestrate a much sought-after White House meeting for Zelensky, which was believed to be critical for the success of his reform agenda in Ukraine, Zelensky instead travelled to Brussels, in part to attend an event hosted by Sondland in his honor, where guests included Leno, Jared Kushner and other senior European Union officials.Twitter users did not see that one coming.'Jay Leno, A$AP Rocky and the Kardashians all now part of the record, and it's not even 10am""You can tell the Kardashians you tried.""

"241",1451317917,"Trumps Signs Stopgap Spending Bill, Averting Shutdown","WASHINGTON (AP) ' President Trump on Thursday signed a short-term funding bill, averting the threat of a government shutdown until next month.Trump signed the bill, which will extend funding through December 20, hours before government funding was set to expire.The Senate, by a 74-20 vote, passed the short-term funding bill earlier in the day.The push to keep the government funded comes as the House is in the midst of contentious public impeachment inquiry hearings. House Democrats are probing whether Trump abused his power by pressing Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son's dealings in that Eastern Europe nation.The stopgap spending bill would give negotiators four more weeks to try and break an impasse involving funding for Trump's border wall project that has gridlocked progress on the 12 appropriations measures that fund about one-third of the government.Talks on the broader full-year appropriations measures have hit a rough patch after the administration rejected bipartisan entreaties to add about $5 billion to grease their path.Negotiations on the full-year measure also could be buffeted by the toxic atmosphere that's worsening because of the ongoing impeachment probe, which could send articles of impeachment to the House floor around the Dec. 20 deadline for averting another potential shutdown.The chief holdup is Trump's demands for up to $8.6 billion more for the U.S.-Mexico border wall. Republicans controlling the Senate have stuck with Trump despite worries that an impasse over his demands could force Congress into resorting to funding the government for the entire budget year at current spending levels.'The appropriations process can go down one of two paths. On the first path, President Trump stays out of our way and gives Congress the space to work together and find an agreement,' said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. 'On the second path, President Trump stomps his feet, makes impossible demands, and prevents his party, the Republicans, from coming to a fair arrangement.'Both sides on Capitol Hill want to avoid any chance of such a full-year continuing resolution, as it is known in Washington-speak. Such an outcome would be an inefficient way to run the government and has particularly negative consequences for the Pentagon budget.The measure contains an assortment of technical provisions to ensure that spending on the 2020 census can ramp up despite delays in the agency's full-year funding bill. It also reverses a planned cut in highway spending next year and offers greater assurances about funding a 3.1 percent pay raise for the military that takes effect Jan. 1.It would extend, for three more months, several surveillance-related provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that expire Dec. 15 and are controversial with civil libertarians.<U+2015>-Associated Press writer Aamer Madhani contributed to this article.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"244",1451418681,"After Two Weeks Of Impeachment Hearings, Here’s What To Take Away","WASHINGTON (AP) ' President Donald Trump asked a foreign country to investigate a political rival as he enters his re-election campaign. That has been established almost beyond doubt. But Republicans and Democrats agree on little else as they embarked on only the fourth impeachment inquiry in the nation's history.One witness explicitly acknowledged a quid pro quo and another spoke of figurative hand grenades and drug deals. A third was the target of disparaging tweets by the president while her testimony was underway.Here are key takeaways from two weeks of hearings.'In the most anticipated testimony, Gordon Sondland, the European Union ambassador, repeatedly described the administration's dealings with Ukraine as a quid pro quo ' one thing in return for another.'I know that members of this committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a `quid pro quo?' As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes,' Sondland said.The deal, he said, involved arranging a White House visit for Ukraine's new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in return for Zelenskiy's announcing investigations of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, and a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Democrat Joe Biden's son Hunter was a Burisma board member.That proposed arrangement was pushed by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, who conveyed Trump's wishes to multiple administration officials.But in testimony that Republicans sought to exploit, Sondland said no one ever told him military aid to Ukraine was contingent on the country announcing investigations ' though he said he came to presume that was the case.'Sondland was central to Trump's efforts to secure investigations by Ukraine.But he insisted that this was no rogue effort, and he would not be a fall guy. He testified how officials across the government were aware of Trump's demand that Ukraine commit to the investigations.Those officials, he said, included Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the White House's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.'Everyone,' Sondland said repeatedly, 'was in the loop. It was no secret.' That also included Vice President Mike Pence, he said.Marc Short, Pence's chief of staff, disputed that account and said that Pence never spoke with Sondland 'about investigating the Bidens, Burisma, or the conditional release of financial aid to Ukraine based upon potential investigations.'In Brussels, Pompeo dismissed Sondland's testimony, but didn't comment on specifics.'Fiona Hill, a former White House adviser and Russia expert, recounted a tense relationship with Sondland. If other people were supportive of the ambassador's efforts, Hill very certainly was not among them.Her testimony vividly outlined the diverging objectives of Trump's official staff and parallel effort led by Giuliani that also involved Sondland.'He was being involved in a domestic political errand,' Hill said of Sondland, 'and we were being involved in national security foreign policy.'In one June blowup, when confronted Sondland over his assertion that he was in charge of Ukraine policy, he replied that Trump had given him authority. She was angry and irritated over the lack of coordinated and warned him that 'this is all going to blow up.''And,' she pointedly added, 'here we are.''Sondland's appearance dominated the day, but a Defense Department official named Laura Cooper provided her own subtly tantalizing testimony.She revealed that Ukrainian Embassy officials had asked about military aid on July 25, earlier than previously known. That could undercut a Republican argument that there couldn't have been a quid pro quo involving military aid because the Ukrainians didn't know that the aid was being held upShe said she also has been recently informed that a Ukrainian Embassy contact had asked a member of her staff that same day 'what was going on' with the aid.The July 25 date is significant: it's the same day Trump spoke by phone with Zelenskiy and pressed for an investigation of Joe Biden.Cooper told lawmakers she 'cannot say for certain' that Ukraine knew the money was being withheld, but she said 'it's the recollection of my staff that they likely knew.''With those words, Alexander Vindman, an Army officer and Purple Heart recipient, sought to shut down Republican attacks on his credibility.Republicans went after him, nonetheless.Republican Rep. Chris Stewart called Vindman's uniform a good reminder of his military service but also questioned why Vindman felt it necessary to wear it rather than a suit.He wanted to know, too, if Vindman always insisted on being referred to by military rank rather than 'Mr.' as he did in an exchange earlier with Rep. Devin Nunes, the committee's top Republican. In that moment, he corrected Nunes and asked to be called 'Lt. Col. Vindman, please.'The committee attacks mirrored the combative approach of the White House, which used its official Twitter account to retweet attacks on Vindman, who continues to work at the White House.Some Republican attacks struggled to land. After Rep. Jim Jordan suggested that Vindman's peers questioned his judgment, Vindman read from a glowing performance review that called him 'brilliant' and 'unflappable.'Other attacks, including from the White House's director of social media, sought to imply that Vindman, a naturalized American citizen who was a toddler when his family fled Ukraine, may have dual loyalties.Under questioning from GOP impeachment counsel Steve Castor, Vindman revealed that he was offered three times the post of Ukraine's defense minister while attending Zelenskiy's inauguration, but 'immediately dismissed these offers.' He says he notified his chain of command and counterintelligence officials upon returning to the U.S.Castor questioned whether that created the impression of a conflict, to which Vindman replied, 'It's more important what my American chain of command thinks.''The testimony of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who last spring was abruptly recalled from Kyiv and directed to return home on the next possible flight, was barely underway when Trump ridiculed her on Twitter, saying without evidence that things 'turned bad' wherever she went during her decades-long career.Yovanovitch left no doubt that she interpreted some of the Trump's cryptic comments about her ' 'she's going to go through some things,' he told Ukraine's president in the July phone call ' in the most chilling way.'It didn't sound good,' she said. 'It sounded like a threat.'She said the effect of the president's comments 'is very intimidating' not just for her but for others who might be similarly inclined root out corruption.Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, read Trump's tweet to Yovanovitch and suggested it was part of a campaign of 'witness intimidation.''Well, I want to let you know, Ambassador, that some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously.'Trump, asked about it later, said, 'I have the right to speak. I have freedom of speech.''The July 26 lunch on an outdoor terrace in a Kyiv restaurant started out social enough. There was a bottle of wine and affable chatter about marketing strategies for Sondland's hotel business.Then, according to David Holmes, a counselor at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv, Sondland said he was going to call Trump to give him an update. The conversation Holmes overheard was loud ' and memorable.At one point, Holmes said, he heard Sondland tell Trump that Zelenskiy 'loves your ass.''I then heard President Trump ask, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?' Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he's gonna do it.'' He said Sondland told Trump that Zelenskiy will do 'anything you ask him to.'When the call ended, Holmes said he asked Sondland if it was true that Trump did not 'give a s<U+2015>t about Ukraine.' Sondland said that it was indeed the case.'I noted that there was 'big stuff' going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia, and Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant 'big stuff' that benefits the president, like the 'Biden investigation' that Mr. Giuliani was pushing.''The British-born Hill is a Russia expert who's written extensively on the Kremlin, and she made that clear from the outset when she scolded Republican lawmakers for propagating what she said was a 'fictional narrative' ' that somehow Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Those discredited theories have been advanced by Trump himself, who in a July 25 phone call at the center of the impeachment inquiry asked Ukraine's leader to investigate the possibility.Hill said the unwillingness by some to accept Russia's role has profound consequences at a time when Russia's security services have 'geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election.' Putin, she said, deploys millions of dollars to 'weaponize our own political opposition research and false narratives.''When we are consumed by partisan rancor, we cannot combat these external forces as they seek to divide us against each another, degrade our institutions, and destroy the faith of the American people in our democracy,' Hill said.At another point, she implored impeachment investigators ' and the country at large ' to stop advancing fictions that she said distract from the attention needed to fight Russian interference.'In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests,' Hill said.'On the first day of hearings, Democrats called on Bill Taylor, a West Point graduate, Vietnam veteran and career diplomat who was recruited out of retirement to serve as a top diplomat in Ukraine.Taylor was unsparing, and colorful, in his characterization of making military aid to Ukraine contingent on the country announcing investigations into the 2016 U.S. election.He was presented with oversized images of a September text message exchange with two other envoys in which he said it would be 'crazy' to withhold military assistance to Ukraine in exchange for that nation investigating Trump's political rival.Those text messages were the among the first documentary pieces of evidence to become public as part of the House impeachment inquiry, and established not only the possible contours of a quid pro quo but also laid bare diplomatic concerns about the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine.'It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do, Taylor said. 'It was illogical, it could not be explained, it was crazy.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here's how.",2019-11-21 23:32:30
"245",1451427281,"Trump Pays Respects To Army Officers Killed In Afghanistan","DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Del. (AP) ' President Donald Trump paid respects Thursday to two Army officers who were killed when their helicopter crashed this week in Afghanistan, holding his salute until each of the flag-draped cases containing their remains were returned to their grieving families.Trump and his wife, Melania, traveled to Dover Air Force Base to offer condolences to the families of Chief Warrant Officer 2 David C. Knadle, 33, and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Kirk T. Fuchigami Jr., 25.The president and first lady led a group of dignitaries that included Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley and National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien. Trump and members of the military saluted and civilians placed a hand over their hearts as a carry team of six white-gloved members of the Army's Old Guard executed the delicate task of transferring the remains from a vehicle the military referred to as a ramp to a waiting vehicle, one case at a time.Trump has said witnessing the dignified transfer of service members' remains is 'the toughest thing I have to do' as president.As the final day of public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry wound down, Trump left the White House for the short flight to the Delaware military base, where the remains of service members killed abroad are returned to U.S. soil.Knadle, of Tarrant, Texas, and Fuchigami Jr., of Keaau, Hawaii, died Wednesday when their helicopter crashed as they provided security for troops on the ground in Logar Province in eastern Afghanistan.Both were assigned to Fort Hood, Texas.Wednesday's crash brought this year's U.S. death toll in Afghanistan to 19, excluding three noncombat deaths.The Taliban claimed responsibility for shooting down the helicopter, but the U.S. military has dismissed that as a false claim. The crash remains under investigation.Trump broke off peace talks with the Taliban in September after a bombing in Kabul that killed 12 people, including an American soldier.Trump and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani spoke on the phone Thursday, the White House announced, and both 'agreed a reduction in violence is necessary to move the peace process forward' and for all-Afghan negotiations regarding a political settlement to be successful.The president also thanked Ghani for his support in seeking the release of two Western hostages the Taliban freed this week after holding them in captivity for more than three years, said spokesman Judd Deere.More than 2,400 Americans have died in the nearly 18-year war.Last month, as Trump sought to justify his unpopular decision to remove a small contingent of U.S. service members from northeastern Syria, he began to describe his experiences at Dover and argue for removing the U.S. from 'endless wars' in the Middle East, which he campaigned on in the 2016 presidential race.The president has described the sight of cavernous aircraft pulling up on the base, doors opening, uniformed service members carrying flag-draped 'transfer cases' and once-stoic parents breaking down.'Sometimes they'll run to the coffin. They'll break through military barriers,' Trump said at an unrelated White House event on Oct. 9. 'They'll run to the coffin and jump on top of the coffin. Crying mothers and wives. Crying desperately.''And this is on these endless wars that just never stop,' he said. 'And there's a time and there's a place, but it's time to stop.'Nothing like the scene Trump described took place at Thursday's ceremony. The families were kept out of sight of the news media.Trump was also joined by Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, Army Sgt. Major Michael Grinston and actor Jon Voight.Trump awarded the Oscar-winning actor the prestigious National Medal of Arts at a White House ceremony earlier Thursday. Voight said in Delaware that Trump invited him to come along if he wanted to.Voight said he did not meet the families but watched from a distance as the soldiers' remains were transferred. He said he accompanied the president because 'I just wanted to pay my respects, say a little prayer.'Thursday's trip was Trump's second to the Delaware military base this year, and his third visit there overall as president.Trump went to the base in January 2019 for the return of four Americans who were killed in a suicide bomb attack in Syria.He attended his first transfer service in February 2017, for the return of a Navy SEAL who was killed during a raid on an al-Qaida compound in Yemen.___Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleapDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"249",1451749524,"Women And Immigrants, Demeaned By Trump, Take Center Stage At Impeachment","When former White House adviser Fiona Hill, who served as the National Security Council's top official on Russian affairs, testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, she described a sharp interaction with'Gordon Sondland.Hill said it began when she had a tense disagreement with the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. 'I actually said to [Sondland], 'Who put you in charge of Ukraine?'' Hill said of the encounter. 'I mean I'll admit I was a bit rude, but that's when he told me the president, which shut me up.'Hill said that she was angry with the ambassador ' and that Sondland dismissed her concerns because she is a woman.''Often, when women show anger, it's not fully appreciated,' she continued. 'It's often pushed onto emotional issues perhaps or deflected onto other people.'Throughout his presidency, Donald Trump'has routinely demeaned, degraded and attacked women and'immigrants. Over the past five days of impeachment hearings, some of the most incriminating testimony has come from those very people.Key witnesses who have testified in the public impeachment hearings, which began last week, include women like'Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Laura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary at the Defense Department, and Jennifer Williams, a top aide to Vice President Mike Pence,'in addition to immigrants like Army Lt. Col.'Alexander Vindman, the NSC's Ukraine expert. (Hill has the distinction of being both an immigrant and a woman.) Day after day, these witnesses laid out a damning case against Trump.Yovanovitch, who served as a foreign service officer for 33 years before Trump recalled her from her post in Ukraine in May, spoke calmly and clearly throughout hours of testimony last week. The cool-headed former ambassador even'responded to'smears from the president in real time during the hearing.'Her testimony was so well-received that she'earned a standing ovation from the public at the hearing (and, later,'at a jazz club in Washington, D.C.).'The former ambassador laid out how the Trump administration'peddled a campaign of lies about her, launched jointly by a Ukrainian official, Trump's'personal attorney'and a host of'right-wing pundits. During his infamous July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump called Yovanovitch 'bad news' and said she was 'going to go through some things.' She testified last week that Trump's statement 'sounded like a threat.''Yovanovitch said that Trump opened the door for corruption by being complicit in 'a campaign of disinformation against a sitting ambassador, using unofficial back channels.' Her experience, she argued, sets a dangerous precedent worldwide.'When other countries, other actors... see that private interests, foreign interests can come together and get a U.S. ambassador removed, what's going to stop them from doing that in the future in other countries?' she said.Cooper, the Defense Department official, clarified a'key timeline question about the withholding of military aid during her Tuesday testimony. She said that Ukraine was aware that the aid was stalled before Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky. If true, this would make it extremely hard to argue that Trump's push for politically beneficial investigations that day wasn't a quid pro quo.Vindman, who was born in Ukraine and immigrated to the U.S. as a toddler, testified as a real-time witness to that now-infamous call. He said there was an obvious 'power disparity' between Zelensky and Trump on the call because of Ukraine's reliance on the U.S. for military and other aid.'When a senior asks you to do something, even when it's polite and pleasant, it's not to be taken as a request <U+2015> it's to be taken as an order,' he told the House Intelligence Committee earlier this week.'Vindman, whose family fled the Soviet Union, is not the typical immigrant targeted by the Trump administration. Those attacks are normally reserved for'Black and'brown'people. But his status as an immigrant was still weaponized against him. Republican lawmakers and conservative cable news hosts'questioned Vindman's loyalty'to the U.S. because he was born in Ukraine.'The 44-year-old Army officer responded to these attacks in one of the more emotional moments of the impeachment hearings. He'addressed his immigrant father'in his opening statement.''I also recognize that my simple act of appearing here today ... would not be tolerated in many places around the world,' Vindman said. 'Dad, my sitting here today in the U.S. Capitol talking to our elected officials is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family. Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.'Hill, an immigrant from the U.K., said the accusations of dual loyalty lobbed at Vindman were 'deeply unfair.'''This is the essence of America,' she said during her Thursday testimony. 'It's why I wanted to be here and why I wanted to stay here, and I think it's unfair to castigate anyone.''I do not believe that my loyalty is to the United Kingdom. My loyalty is here, to the United States. This is my country and the country that I serve,' Hill continued. 'And I know for a fact that every single one of my colleagues <U+2015> and there were many naturalized citizens in my office and across the National Security Council <U+2015> felt exactly the same way.'During Hill's testimony, Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.) said that she was 'especially disheartened' by Trump's treatment of women throughout this process, specifically his ongoing attacks on Yovanovitch.'She was an easy target as a woman,' Sewell said.'The fact of the matter is that there's a long line of strong, talented women who have been smeared and victimized by this president,' the congresswoman continued. 'We can either choose to ignore it or do something about it.'After the hearing, Rep. Andr' Carson (D-Ind.) said, 'I think for a certain pocket of society who are perpetuating harmful mythologies about immigrants and women, and who are trying to take our country back to some mythological good old days <U+2015> I think it's important to have representation from women and those who have immigrant backgrounds to dismantle this notion of what it means to be an American.'It's possible that the dual-loyalty smears against Vindman are a sneak peek of what's to come as the pressure increases on the president. Given Trump's history, stoking fears around citizenship and gender for political gain would be nothing new.'Igor Bobic contributed reporting.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

(U.S. intelligence officials have repeatedly affirmed it was Russia who interfered in the 2016 election.)'A lot of it had to do, they say, with Ukraine. They have the server, right? From the DNC,' he said. 'That's what the word is.'In damning testimony on Thursday, former National Security Council official Fiona Hill repeatedly urged Republicans to stop pushing the conspiracy theory.'I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U.S. adversary, and that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked us in 2016,' Hill said. 'These fictions are harmful even if they are deployed for purely domestic political purposes.'Friday's nearly hourlong interview devolved into a soliloquy, which frequently occurs when Trump calls into 'Fox & Friends,' Fox News' morning program that is typically friendly toward him.Trump rambled and mentioned, often without context, some of his favorite targets, including (but not limited to): 'shifty' and 'sick puppy' Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who's leading the House impeachment inquiry; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), whom Trump referred to as 'a bedbug'; former FBI Director James Comey, whom he called 'a totally disgusting human being'; and 'the two lovers,' former FBI staffers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.Even the 'Fox & Friends' hosts seemed perplexed at times, trying to squeeze in questions for the president and get him back on track ' to little avail.Co-host Ainsley Earhardt repeatedly tried to shift the conversation to the 2020 campaign, but Trump frequently brought it back to his grievances over the impeachment proceedings.When Trump finally did field questions on the Democratic primary field, he suggested former Vice President Joe Biden might not 'make it mentally. He's off.'Trump also revived his racial slur against Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), referring to her as 'Pocahontas.'At times, the hosts attempted to push back on his false claims or ask him to clarify. Co-host Steve Doocy asked Trump to provide a source for his spurious assertion that former President Barack Obama's administration 'spied on my campaign.' Trump would not name a source.Doocy also debunked Trump's false claim that only the U.S. gives aid to Ukraine, one of his defenses against the July 25 call to Ukraine's president, which is at the center of the impeachment inquiry.More than 50 minutes into Friday's phone interview, after asking about the president's health, co-host Brian Kilmeade suggested Trump call into the program every week as a form of 'stress relief.''Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"252",1452006507,"Rick Perry, Tied To Ukraine Scandal, Becomes An Issue In Closely Watched Texas Race","When moderate House Democrats lined up behind an impeachment inquiry, it looked as if those among them facing primary challenges from the left would be depriving their competitors of a powerful talking point.But the emergence of Energy Secretary Rick Perry as a figure of interest in the impeachment hearings has complicated that calculation in one of the country's most contentious Democratic primary races.Rep. Henry Cuellar, an eight-term incumbent whose 28th Congressional District covers parts of South Texas, is a longtime friend of Perry's <U+2015> shortly after the latter began his lengthy tenure as Texas' governor, Cuellar served as his secretary of state, an appointed position. Now, the 64-year-old Cuellar faces a 2020 primary challenge from Jessica Cisneros, 26, an immigration and human rights attorney who has sought to make an issue out of Cuellar's ties to Republicans <U+2015> including Perry.She has taken to calling Cuellar, who has broken with Democratic Party orthodoxy on gun regulations, immigration enforcement and abortion rights, 'Donald Trump's favorite Democrat.' And on'Thursday, Cisneros demanded that Perry testify before the House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the impeachment inquiry. She didn't name Cuellar, but the implication was clear.'We continue to hear credible testimony from witnesses appearing in the impeachment inquiry that Energy Secretary Rick Perry was both 'in the loop' and may have played a role in Donald Trump's corrupt attempted bribery of Ukraine for his personal political benefit ' and yet Secretary Perry has refused to do his duty and honor the Congressional subpoena to testify about what he knows,' she said in a statement. 'When I serve in Congress, honoring our Democracy and upholding the Constitution will be among my highest obligations, but I know those outcomes rely on public servants like Secretary Perry to be willing to put country ahead of political party.'Perry has refused to testify in closed-door impeachment hearings.Pressure on him to testify is likely to grow stronger following this week's explosive round of public testimony. U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland told the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday that Perry was part of an instrumental group of Trump administration officials tasked with creating a backchannel to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the purpose of pursuing political investigations to benefit Trump. (Perry has denied Sondland's version of events, through a spokesperson.)Asked whether he would echo Cisneros' call for Perry to testify, Cuellar appeared to endorse the idea without mentioning Perry by name.'My position is unchanged: anyone with information should appear before the committee and answer questions under oath,' Cuellar told HuffPost in a statement.Cisneros said she does not believe that Cuellar's statement amounts to a request that Perry testify.'Secretary Perry has refused to do his duty and honor the congressional subpoena to testify and produce any relevant documents,' she said on Friday. 'As a longtime friend of Perry, I urge Congressman Cuellar to join me in calling on Secretary Perry to testify about what he knows.'Cuellar, who is an attorney, served under Perry only briefly as Texas' secretary of state, leaving office in October 2001 after just six months in the post. Cuellar went on to run for Congress in 2002, winning on his second go-round in 2004.During his time in Congress, Cuellar has maintained warm relations with Perry. He was the only House Democrat to vote against a 2012 resolution condemning the name of Perry's family ranch, which includes a racial slur for African Americans. That same year, he broke with his Democratic colleagues in the state when he declined to oppose the then-governor's partisan redistricting plan. And according to Andrew Kreighbaum, who was a local reporter at the time, Cuellar even spoke about the possibility of feeling conflicted if Perry were the GOP nominee against then-President Barack Obama in 2012.When Trump nominated Perry to his Cabinet, Cuellar spoke up on his behalf and urged his colleagues in the Senate to vote yes on his confirmation.Cisneros was raised in the 28th district and moved back to it from New York to run for Congress. Backed by the left-wing group Justice Democrats'as well as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York'and Democratic presidential hopeful Sen.'Elizabeth Warren'of Massachusetts, Cisneros' campaign is based on the premise that a solidly Democratic district deserves a more progressive representative in Washington.She is running on a progressive platform of fighting for 'Medicare for All,' a Green New Deal and a more humane immigration policy. But she has also raised eyebrows by picking up the backing of more mainstream Democratic validators, including some local labor unions and the deep-pocketed, pro-abortion rights group EMILY's List.Cuellar maintains that his bipartisan approach is in keeping with the heavily Latino, low-income district's preferences. He has the endorsement of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).This story has been updated with additional comments by Cisneros.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"253",1452006478,"Republicans Insist That No, Really, Trump Cares Deeply About Corruption Everywhere","WASHINGTON <U+2015> A key Republican defense of President Donald Trump is that the cadre of diplomatic witnesses are simply mistaken that he tried to extort Ukraine into announcing a sham investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden. Their truth is that Trump was just fighting corruption.'President Trump had good reason to be wary of Ukrainian election meddling against his campaign and of widespread corruption in that country,' Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said at Thursday's impeachment hearing.But ask Republican lawmakers if they've ever heard Trump express an interest in rooting out corruption in other countries, or even mention corruption in Ukraine before Biden got into the 2020 Democratic presidential race this April, and their minds go blank.'If the subject was Ukraine, he's expressed his concern about corruption in Ukraine, which everybody understood was endemic <U+2015> including [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelensky, who won. So I haven't talked to the president about other countries where that might have come up,' said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who serves as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation and as vice chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus.'You mean other than what I've heard over the news? We've never had that discussion,' said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), another fierce ally of the president.In 2016, Trump campaigned on 'draining the swamp' in Washington, shorthand for cleaning up the government and chasing away lobbyists. But he's been one of the swampiest presidents of all time, refusing even to take the most basic step of divesting from his private business. When foreign dignitaries travel to Washington, they line Trump's pockets by staying at his hotel.'And he's shown an affinity for autocratic leaders of nations where corruption is rampant, like Russia, North Korea, China, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, turning a blind eye to the way they run their governments.After Biden jumped into the Democratic primary in April, however, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani suddenly began planning a trip to Kyiv, seeking to push the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations helpful to Trump ahead of his reelection campaign in 2020. It was those investigations that Trump urged Zelensky to advance in their July 25 phone call <U+2015> the call that is now the subject of the House impeachment inquiry.Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee who has voiced deep skepticism of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry this week, argues that Republicans don't have to prove that Trump actually cares about corruption.''Corruption within any country should be rooted out and having two heads of state agree on that seems to be, on its face, fine. So we don't have to prove anything else,' Conaway said.Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who is one of the president's biggest defenders in Congress, said no when asked if he could point to other examples of Trump fighting corruption.''The focus has been on what happened in Ukraine,' Jordan said, adding that the president is skeptical of foreign aid, that Ukraine is deeply corrupt and that Ukraine's new president had pledged to clean house. 'So you couple all that together.'Other Republicans highlighted instances of foreign or domestic policy changes <U+2015> such as the reorganization of the Department of Agriculture <U+2015> that were not primarily about corruption. Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah), another Intelligence Committee member, pointed to the president's March announcement that he would cut foreign aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to try to stop migrants from coming to the U.S.''You've got nearly failed states and the reason is corruption,' Stewart said.'Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the second-ranking Republican in the House, said the president held up the aid not just because of corruption, but because he wanted to signal to other countries that they needed to help Ukraine as well.''Germany was an example where he was saying, look, the United States is helping but other countries need to step up too and help Ukraine,' Scalise said. 'It wasn't only about corruption. It was also about having other countries do more of their fair share.'It turns out that other countries have together helped Ukraine more than the U.S. has, and the Trump administration knows it. On Thursday, David Holmes, a political counselor to the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, told the Intelligence Committee that the embassy researched the burden-sharing question in August. They told the White House that since 2014, the U.S. has provided Ukraine about $3 billion in aid, while European Union nations have provided a combined $12 billion.''If the concern was that others were not spending what we were to support Ukraine, that showed a different story,' Holmes said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"254",1452078698,"John Bolton Hints He's Ready To Spill His 'Backstory' On White House Departure","President Donald Trump's former National Security Adviser John Bolton'says he's ready to share the 'backstory' of his departure from the White House.Bolton took to Twitter on Friday to tease his forthcoming story, claiming the White House had previously 'suppressed' his Twitter account to prevent him from speaking out about the details surrounding his resignation in September.'Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months,' Bolton tweeted. 'For the backstory, stay tuned........'We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor.  More to come.....Re: speaking up -- since resigning as National Security Advisor, the @WhiteHouse refused to return access to my personal Twitter account.  Out of fear of what I may say? To those who speculated I went into hiding, I'm sorry to disappoint!It wasn't immediately clear how or why the White House would have prevented Bolton from posting on the social media platform until Friday. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump fired Bolton in September, though the former national security adviser denied that report and claimed he had turned in his resignation voluntarily.'I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,' Trump announced in a pair of tweets on Sept. 10. 'I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore ... I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning.'Bolton was known for being a hawk on Iran, North Korea and Syria. His'aggressive foreign policy approach and eagerness for war frequently clashed with Trump's own approach for less military intervention.Lawmakers have called on Bolton to testify as part of the House's impeachment inquiry into Trump. Bolton's lawyer, Charles Cooper, has said Bolton would be willing to do so if a court rules he must, given that the'White House has chosen not to cooperate with the inquiry.In a letter to the chief House lawyer earlier this month, Cooper said Bolton knows about 'many relevant meetings and conversations' surrounding Trump's communications with Ukraine.According to Cooper's letter, which he provided to HuffPost, Bolton 'was personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations about which [lawmakers] have already received testimony, as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.'Bolton was reportedly concerned about Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the Democratic frontrunners for 2020, and his son Hunter. At one point, Bolton even'ordered an aide to warn White House attorneys about Giuliani's behavior.Bolton, however,'failed to show up'on Nov. 7 for his scheduled deposition by lawmakers in the impeachment inquiry. He is one of several current and former Trump administration officials who have not appeared for their closed-door depositions.'Cooper said Bolton 'stands ready' to testify if courts resolve the 'conflicting demands of the Legislative and Executive Branches.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"257",1452162908,"Rep. Steve King Retweeted Far-Right Influencer With History Of Holocaust Denial","Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) earlier this week promoted a far-right influencer with a history of Holocaust denial and anti-immigrant bigotry, who once tweeted, 'Hitler had some good points. I think the Holocaust never actually happened.'The post King highlighted on Nov. 16 came from Peter Sweden, a YouTube and Twitter personality who was telling his followers to 'be a rebel' and 'save society' through marriage, children and homeschooling. King quote-tweeted him <U+2015> stating 'The best thing for our country is for good people to have a lot of babies and raise them right' <U+2015> before deleting the tweet with no explanation less than three hours later.'King's office did not immediately respond on Friday to HuffPost's request for comment about the congressman's tweet and what led to his deleting it.'The tweet was posted at 8:10 a.m. Eastern time and was up for at least an hour on Saturday morning. King then deleted the quote-tweet and replaced it with a post at 10:28 a.m. that lacked the connection to the far-right account.Peter Sweden is the pseudonym of Peter Imanuelsen, a media influencer who frequently tweets anti-immigrant and Islamophobic rhetoric. Until a few years ago, he also openly promoted violently homophobic and misogynist views, as well as Holocaust denial.Imanuelsen has disavowed outright anti-Semitism in recent years, claiming to have abandoned his Holocaust denial and insisting that he is not a white nationalist. But he still posts far-right vitriol targeting Muslims, refugees and feminism.'Although his public persona generally revolves around conflating immigration with crime and sexual assault in Sweden, Imanuelsen was born in Norway and as recently as 2012 had registered a business as a British national (he subsequently registered as Swedish). He has also appeared on extremist conspiracy outlets such as Infowars.Imanuelsen contacted HuffPost after this article's publication to restate his claim that he does not deny the occurrence of the Holocaust, adding that 'the Holocaust was a horrible atrocity that should never happen again.''It's disturbing yet not surprising that Rep. Steve King would quote tweet PeterSweden'<U+2015> a far-right influencer notorious for his extreme racist, anti-Semitic, Christian fundamentalist, homophobic, Islamophobic, anti-feminist and conspiracist commentary, which in the past included Holocaust denial,' said a spokesperson from the Anti-Defamation League.'As documented by ADL, Rep. King has a long history of dabbling in white nationalism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism. To quote tweet PeterSweden is right on brand for Rep. King. We have previously called on the House of Representatives to censure the Congressman for his behavior,' the spokesperson said.King has repeatedly retweeted white nationalists and neo-Nazis, and has met with far-right politicians across Europe. Although he has rarely deleted such posts, he recently removed both his retweet of Imanuelsen and a Nov. 14 tweet promoting a conspiracy theory that billionaire George Soros' son was the whistleblower whose report led to the House impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump.'King's reference to 'good people' having 'a lot of babies' is also notable given his fixation on birth rates and his white nationalist worldview. Far-right politicians such as King have long stoked ethno-nationalist sentiment that immigrants are not true citizens, as well as tried to increase domestic birth rates as a means of shutting down immigration.'King gave an extensive interview last year to an Austrian far-right propaganda site lamenting that abortion was depriving the U.S. of babies and referencing immigration as 'slow-motion cultural suicide.' The interview included references to the 'great replacement' conspiracy theory popular among white nationalists and violent extremists such as the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooter.The House Republican leadership stripped King of his committee assignments earlier this year after the congressman questioned why white supremacy and white nationalism were offensive in a'New York Times interview.Clarification: Language has been amended to characterize the particulars of Imanuelsen's nationalities. The article has also been updated with comment from Imanuelsen.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here's how.",2019-11-22 16:25:50

"259",1452232108,"Trump’s Lawyers Argue Like They’re Defending King Donald I","WASHINGTON ' The Oval Office's occupant is President Donald Trump, but his battalion of private and taxpayer-funded lawyers are making arguments that may seem better suited for a King Donald I.Trump's private lawyers have argued that New York state prosecutors in Manhattan investigating hush-money payments to two women, as well as House members seeking Trump's financial records, have no right to such information because he enjoys 'presidential immunity.' Lawyers in his White House counsel's office, meanwhile, call the ongoing impeachment inquiry illegitimate and have refused to cooperate with it.'It's hubris run amok. They're feeling that their executive prerogative has no bounds,' said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, who added that while many presidents have asserted executive privilege, Trump and his Justice Department are interpreting it to mean that he is literally above the law. 'I've never seen a president so brazen before. This takes executive power to sort of a dictatorial level.'Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a New York University history professor and expert on authoritarian regimes, said the basis of Trump's impeachment inquiry ' his attempt to coerce a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent ' is particularly alarming. 'They don't seem to want to leave the election to a fair and free vote,' she said. 'They don't even offer a real reason, which is another retreat from democracy.'The White House declined to respond to HuffPost's queries for this story.Trump, in an interview on his favorite morning television show Friday, again disparaged the inquiry himself. 'It's a hoax,' he told 'Fox & Friends.' 'This is a continuation of the witch hunt which has gone on from before I got elected.'On Oct. 8, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone sent Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi an eight-page letter ' replete with Trumpian phrasing 'declaring that the House's impeachment inquiry was illegal.'Your highly partisan and unconstitutional effort threatens grave and lasting damage to our democratic institutions, to our system of free elections, and to the American people,' Cipollone wrote. 'President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.'Based on that decree, senior administration officials including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Energy Secretary Rick Perry have refused to honor congressional demands to appear at the impeachment hearings. The White House and Trump's executive branch agencies have refused to turn over requested documents.Jordan Libowitz, whose group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has filed numerous lawsuits to force Trump's agencies to disclose documents, said he understands Trump's desire to keep negative information under wraps.'Our founders designed three co-equal branches set to check and balance each other. If they wanted a king, they would have made a constitutional monarchy. They did not,' Libowitz said.It's uncertain whether Trump's attempts to block people from testifying or releasing records will succeed. President Richard Nixon tried to block the release of certain recordings of his White House conversations, but the Supreme Court ruled against him ' ultimately leading to his resignation. President Bill Clinton tried to avoid giving testimony in a lawsuit by a former Arkansas employee, but the high court ruled against him, too, resulting in his sitting for a deposition that became the basis for his impeachment in 1998.Circuit Court Judge Robert Katzmann, author of a Nov. 4 ruling against Trump in a federal appeals court in New York, said that releasing presidential tax returns does not seem particularly burdensome. 'We note that the past six presidents, dating back to President Carter, all voluntarily released their tax returns to the public,' Katzmann wrote. 'While we do not place dispositive weight on this fact, it reinforces our conclusion that the disclosure of personal financial information, standing alone, is unlikely to impair the president in performing the duties of his office.'The legal cases aside, Trump has already watched a parade of officials from within his executive agencies appear before investigators, offering both closed-door depositions and public testimony. White House officials realized that threatening to fire employees would be a public relations disaster. Further, a fired employee would at that point have no incentive to avoid testifying.And those witnesses who have testified ' including a trio of political appointees ' have provided a trove of details confirming and giving context for the allegations in a whistleblower's complaint that Trump had asked Ukraine's president for politically useful investigations in a July 25 phone call.'It is good to be king, but Trump will never know what that is like,' said Rick Tyler, a Republican political consultant who worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2016 presidential primaries.According to witness testimony as well as the rough transcript of that phone call, Trump demanded that Ukraine investigate the Democrat he feared most in 2020 as well as support a conspiracy theory that falsely claims that Russian intelligence agencies did not help Trump win the 2016 election, but rather that it was Ukrainian officials who framed Russia by using fake evidence. He made the military aid to Ukraine contingent on its government publicly announcing the probes but then backed down after the White House learned that the whistleblower's complaint was about to reach Congress.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Napolitano also noted that Trump 'hasn't presented a defense, and I don't know if he plans to.''Top of Napolitano's list of articles of impeachment that he expects the Democrats to bring is bribery, referring to Trump's withholding of nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid as he pressed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky'in a July phone call to launch an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden and Biden's son.'The Democrats will 'argue that the president's failure to disburse funds that the Congress ordered be disbursed until the recipient of the funds agreed to investigate a potential political opponent is an act of bribery,' Napolitano explained. 'That is enough ... to make it over the threshold of impeachable offenses. I don't think it's enough to convict of bribery, but it's enough to allege it.''The second charge will likely be 'high crimes and misdemeanors ' election law violation,' Napolitano noted. The third crime will be 'obstruction of justice,' while the fourth could be 'interference with a witness,' he said.A fifth may be 'lying under oath,' noted Napolitano. That would stem from Trump's alleged lie under oath to special counsel Robert Mueller when he said he didn't recall discussing WikiLeaks and hacked Democratic Party emails with'Roger Stone. That contradicts testimony at Stone's trial, in which Trump's longtime friend and informer adviser was convicted of all seven charges levied against him, including lying to Congress and witness intimidation.Check the clip above to find out what could constitute a constitutional crisis in the case.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) met with a former Ukrainian prosecutor who was ousted over corruption concerns in a bid to get dirt on Joe Biden, CNN reported Friday.A lawyer for Parnas, a Soviet-born American who has been indicted on federal campaign finance violations, said his client found out about the European meeting directly from the Ukrainian official.'Mr. Parnas learned from former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin that Nunes had met with Shokin in Vienna last December,' attorney Joseph Bondy told CNN.Shokin was forced out of office by Ukraine's Parliament in 2016 under pressure from the U.S. and other Western nations over concerns he was soft on corruption. As vice president at the time, Biden was active in pushing for Shokin's ouster.Bondy also told CNN that Parnas worked to connect Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, with other Ukrainians who allegedly could come up with negative information on former Vice President Biden and the Democrats. If true, Nunes would be the first member of Congress linked to gathering opposition research on President Donald Trump's political rival from a former foreign official, CNN noted ' and one with a score to settle with Biden, who had pushed for Shokin's ouster.Nunes declined repeated requests from CNN to comment.The attorney told CNN that Parnas is willing to comply with a congressional subpoena for documents and testimony as part of its impeachment inquiry.

According to Parnas, Nunes met in Vienna last December with controversial former Ukraine prosecutor Viktor Shokin, CNN reported Friday. Shokin was forced out of office by the Ukrainian Parliament over corruption concerns in 2016 under pressure from the U.S. and Western allies. Biden was a key part of the effort to drive him out when he was vice president.Shokin himself informed Parnas ' who has been indicted on federal campaign finance violations ' about the meeting with Nunes, according to CNN.'ahem https://t.co/jLP0gxcO8N pic.twitter.com/BAEBMpJUkNThe meeting could turn out to be explosive for Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, who lambasted Democrats and the media at impeachment hearings.Former federal prosecutor Elie Honig noted in a CNN interview Saturday that Nunes may have done exactly what Trump is being accused of: using his office to solicit something of value (dirt on Biden) from a foreign national ' a 'corrupt prosecutor' ' to use in a political campaign.'It is really bad news for Devin Nunes,' said Honig, who noted the 'sheer hypocrisy' of Nunes 'up on his high horse ... preaching about what's right and wrong' at House impeachment hearings.

He said lawmakers will compile a report about their findings as they continue to probe the president's dealings with Ukraine.Schiff, during an appearance on NBC's 'Meet The Press,' said the House won't wait to move forward with impeachment while courts potentially take months to decide whether witnesses the White House has blocked from testifying can do so.''We've already accumulated quite overwhelming evidence that the president once again sought foreign interference in the election, conditioned official acts <U+2015> a White House meeting that Ukraine desperately wanted <U+2015> as well as $400 million of bipartisan taxpayer funding to get these political investigations that he thought would help his reelection,' Schiff said.He continued: 'There are still other witnesses, other documents that we would like to obtain, but we are not willing to go the months and months and months of rope-a-dope in the courts, which the administration would more than love for us to do.'Later, on CNN's 'State Of The Union,' Schiff said he would welcome testimony from firsthand witnesses, including Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, but said the House must 'act now' instead of waiting and acquiescing to the president's 'obstruction.''The case in terms of the Ukraine conduct is ironclad but so is the case of the president's obstruction of Congress,' he added.Schiff on why Democrats aren't waiting to call more witnesses: ""We're not willing to simply allow them to wait us out, to stall this proceeding when the facts are already overwhelming ... We're going to continue our investigation"" #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/RpFk5fWuMFThe White House's decision to block key witnesses from testifying has created a challenge for House impeachment investigators seeking to paint the most complete picture of Trump's actions.During a press conference last month, Mulvaney confirmed a 'quid pro quo' in which Trump used U.S. military aid as leverage in an effort to get Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden. He later walked back his statement and has defied a congressional subpoena to testify in the impeachment inquiry.Giuliani, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence have defied subpoenas for documents related to the inquiry, but haven't been asked to testify.Former National Security Adviser John Bolton, meanwhile, declined a House invitation to testify and has asked a federal judge to decide whether he should do so or follow White House orders not to.Schiff on Sunday urged Bolton to show 'courage' like former National Security Council official Fiona Hill did last week in testifying before Congress.'He will have to explain, one day, if he maintains that position why he wanted to wait to put it in a book instead of telling the American people what he knew when it really mattered to the country,' he told CNN.Adam Schiff on John Bolton's refusal to testify before Congress: ""He will have to explain, one day, if he maintains that position why he wanted to wait to put it in a book instead of telling the American people what he knew when it really mattered to the country"" #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/W7cN6zhMtEAsked whether his committee would hand over their impeachment report to the House Judiciary Committee by early December, Schiff wouldn't say.'We will take the time that's necessary,' he said. 'We have continued to learn more information every day. And I think that's going to continue. So, we may have file addendums to that report. We may have other depositions and hearings to do.'He added that he's not ready to say whether he will recommend articles of impeachment to the judiciary committee, but said it's 'entirely possible' that additional witnesses could be called if there's a trial in the Senate.Over the last two weeks, several current and former State Department officials have publicly testified before Congress that Trump inappropriately pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden, a frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.Republicans have dismissed some witness testimony as 'hearsay,' though the White House has blocked witnesses with firsthand accounts from appearing before Congress.

'When they say that, I say, 'He isn't, but I have insurance.''In a similar comment earlier this month, Giuliani told the Guardian that he has 'very, very good insurance' and 'all my hospital bills will be paid.'His lawyer,'Robert Costello, interjected during the interview asserting that it was a joke.Giuliani has become a key figure in impeachment proceedings as State Department officials have mentioned his name several times in their testimonies on whether Trump engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine.At the center of the inquiry is Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he pressed Zelensky to assist Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr with a probe of the Bidens, based on the unsubstantiated corruption accusations. The request raised concerns that Trump was looking to handicap the Democratic presidential candidate who has emerged as Trump's political rival.At the time of the call, American military aid was being withheld from Ukraine, spurring questions over a possible quid pro quo.However, Giuliani's tweeted claim that he possesses unreleased documents showing malfeasance on Biden's part further muddied the waters, given Trump's expressed interest in discovering wrongdoing by the former vice president.In October, Giuliani defied a subpoena from House lawmakers seeking documents pertaining to his involvement in the Ukraine scandal. In a letter to Congress, Giuliani's attorney at the time, Jon Sale, contended that it was 'beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry,' and bashed the impeachment probe as 'unconstitutional, baseless, and illegitimate.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

John Kennedy (R-La.) on Sunday suggested Ukraine'may have hacked the Democratic National Committee's servers in 2016 <U+2015> an assertion that bucks the assessment of the entire U.S. intelligence community, and also happens to echo a debunked conspiracy theory often peddled by President Donald Trump.Asked during an appearance on 'Fox News Sunday' whether Russia was behind the cyberattack, as the CIA and Department of Homeland Security have concluded, Kennedy falsely claimed that nobody knows.<U+2033>I don't know,' he told host Chris Wallace. 'Nor do you. Nor do any of us.'Wallace interrupted to point out that the 'entire intelligence community says it was Russia.'<U+2033>Right, but it could also be Ukraine,' Kennedy said.On FOX News Sunday: Louisiana Senator John Kennedy reacts to President Trump saying Ukraine may have the DNC server, an idea that runs contrary to the intelligence community. Chris asks Senator Kennedy who he thinks is responsible for hacking the DNC. #FNS #FoxNews pic.twitter.com/zBbzuoXSjeThe U.S. intelligence community has stated definitively that Russia hacked the DNC's servers and leaked thousands of emails in an effort to help Trump win the presidency in 2016. Trump has claimed, without evidence, that Ukraine was behind the cyberattack.In September, Tom Bossert, a former homeland security adviser to Trump, said that idea is 'completely false' and 'completely debunked.''It has no validity,' Bossert told ABC News. 'The United States government reached its conclusion on attributing to Russia the DNC hack in 2016 before it even communicated it to the FBI.'Several current and former State Department officials, while testifying before Congress as part of the impeachment inquiry, have also said the Ukraine hacking claim has no basis in reality.Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, testified that Russia has pushed the Ukraine hacking theory in an effort to obscure its own role in the attack and sow discord within the U.S. political system.'Our nation is being torn apart,' Hill said. 'Truth is questioned. Our highly professional, expert career foreign service is being undermined.'But Kennedy, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that's simply 'her opinion.''I'm not saying that I know one way or another,' he said Sunday. 'I'm saying Ms. Hill is entitled to her opinion, but no rebuttal evidence was allowed to be offered.''We know that, at least that the Republicans in the House wanted to call a witness, a DNC political operative who lobbied the Ukrainian Embassy to be involved, get involved in 2016 election,' he continued. 'We don't know if Ukraine did that. We don't know to what extent.'Kennedy was apparently referring to Alexandra Chalupa, a co-chair of the DNC's Ethnic Council who worked with Ukrainian Embassy officials in 2016 to research former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's Russia ties. There is no evidence, however, that Ukraine coordinated with Chalupa or the DNC to influence the election.Wallace concluded the interview by telling Kennedy that it's 'always interesting to talk to you and even more interesting to listen to you.'Asked Sunday why Trump doesn't believe his own Justice Department and intelligence officials about the Russian cyberattack,'presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway claimed he actually does.'The president has said he accepts that, but also there are plenty of ways to interfere in an election,' Conway told CBS' 'Face The Nation.'When host Margaret Brennan pressed Conway to answer specifically about Trump's claims that Ukraine was behind the DNC hack, the White House aide pivoted to attacking Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and the media.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"271",1453471881,"Emails Show Trump Admin Made Major Attempt To Justify Ukraine Aid Delay: Report","A trove of documents has revealed that members of President Donald Trump's administration engaged in an extensive effort to justify his holdup of American military aid to Ukraine over the summer, The Washington Post reported Sunday.A confidential White House review of the decision found hundreds of documents showing that officials searched for ways to defend the president's delay of the funds <U+2015> a central focus of the House impeachment probe <U+2015> according to three people with knowledge of the records.The Post reported that email exchanges from early August indicate acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, along with members of the Office of Management and Budget, sought to explain why Trump ordered in mid-July that almost $400 million be withheld, just days before his now-infamous call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During that call, Trump pressed Zelensky repeatedly for assistance with a corruption probe of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, based on unfounded corruption accusations.At the time of the call, Trump had already hit pause on the aid, raising concerns that there may have been a quid pro quo with Zelensky. The money was released on Sept. 11.People familiar with OMB's handling of the matter told the Post that the conversations were 'calm, routine and focused on the legal question of how to comply with the congressional Budget and Impoundment Act, which requires the executive branch to spend congressionally appropriated funds unless Congress agrees they can be rescinded,' the outlet reported.As the documents included in the White House's review were not published, it remains unclear exactly what was communicated by Mulvaney and OMB officials.In October, Mulvaney acknowledged during a press conference that there was, in fact, a quid pro quo with Ukraine, telling reporters 'we do that all the time with foreign policy' and that they should 'get over it.'Hours later, Mulvaney made a total reversal, releasing a statement slamming the media for attempting 'to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against' the president, and claiming that 'there was absolutely no quid pro quo.'Earlier this month, Mark Sandy, a longtime OMB official, appeared before the House Intelligence Committee for closed-door testimony, making him the only member of the agency to participate in the impeachment inquiry so far.Sandy told lawmakers that the delay in funds was very unusual and that senior OMB political appointees wanted to review the aid package, the Post reported.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Days before she announced her decision to step down, the House Ethics Committee launched a probe into allegations that she had a sexual relationship with her legislative director, which she has denied.

"273",1453530747,"Devin Nunes Dodges Questions About Whether He Met With Ukrainians For Dirt On Biden","Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) dodged questions on Sunday from a Fox News host asking whether he met with a former Ukrainian official in 2018 to acquire dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden.The lawyer for Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump, told CNN'that Parnas is prepared to tell Congress that he is aware of a 2018 meeting between Nunes and former Ukrainian prosecutor general Victor Shokin, who was ousted for corruption in 2016; that he learned of this meeting directly from Shokin; and that the express purpose of the meeting was for Nunes to get information on Biden.Appearing on 'Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo,' Nunes was asked simply whether he had been in Vienna, Austria, with Shokin.'Look, Maria, I really want to answer all of these questions,' Nunes told Fox's Maria Bartiromo. 'And I absolutely will come back on this show and answer these questions,' he said, before saying he couldn't speak on the matter because it involved law enforcement. But as he continued, Nunes implied that unfavorable coverage, rather than procedural carefulness, might explain why he would not say whether he'd met with Ukrainian officials for dirt on a U.S. presidential candidate.'I can't compete by trying to debate this out with the public media when 90% of the media are totally corrupt,' Nunes said. The congressman went on to make the unfounded claim that it is 'very likely' that CNN committed crimes in reporting the story, and he threatened to take the network to court to discover the process by which the report came together.Nunes has been one of the White House's most reliable allies in Congress, particularly when it has come to defending allegations of presidential misconduct. In 2017, as the investigation into Trump's relationship with Russia kicked into full swing, Nunes reportedly coordinated with the White House on ways to spin the story into a conspiracy about anti-Trump sentiment within the intelligence community. And as the House's impeachment inquiry into Trump's dealings with Ukraine has moved forward, Nunes has repeatedly suggested ' contrary to U.S. intelligence officials own assessments ' that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election on Democrats' behalf.Nunes told Bartiromo the the CNN report about his own effort in Ukraine is 'demonstrably false,' but he declined to state which parts were untrue or provide any evidence to support his claims.

"275",1454199336,"People Are Doubling Down On Their Opinions On Impeachment, Poll Finds","Days of televised impeachment hearings have left Americans largely dug into their original opinions, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds, dashing Democrats' hopes that the testimony might finally splinter the president's base of support and Republicans' predictions that the hearings would backfire on their opponents.'The poll was conducted starting Wednesday night, after a day of House hearings during which Gordon Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, testified that President Donald Trump engaged in a quid pro quo with aid to Ukraine. Republicans largely dismissed that testimony as meaningless, while Democrats heralded it as a bombshell <U+2015> a split that mirrors broader public opinion.The public is nearly evenly split on whether Trump should be removed from office, the survey found, with 45% saying he should and 42% that he should not. That's identical to the results of'a survey taken a week earlier, and within the range of 44% to 48% shown in HuffPost/YouGov polling since late September. (Contrary to Trump's tweet'on Monday morning, polls do not show impeachment support 'dropping like a rock,' although taken as a whole, they do suggest it has leveled off and may have ticked down from its peak.)'Americans say, 42% to 31%, that they think Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in order to get the Ukrainian president to investigate the Biden family. Just 16% say doing so would be appropriate, with 26% calling it inappropriate but not impeachable, and 40% saying it's an impeachable offense. The responses were little changed from the previous survey.Underlying those numbers is a familiar political divide. People who voted for Trump's rival in 2016 remain staunchly against him. Some expressed frustration that the impeachment hearings haven't had a more immediate effect in changing minds.'I felt that if the Republicans actually listened, they would also want to impeach & remove Trump,' wrote a woman in Texas who voted for Hillary Clinton. Mused another Clinton voter from Ohio, 'I kept wondering if the Democrats & Republicans were listening to the same testimonies.'Trump's base of supporters, however, shows no signs of turning on him en masse.'I thought the hearing is a 'he said-she said' and as many would say, a witch hunt to get President Trump and such a waste of our government's time, money, and resources,' wrote a Trump voter from Arizona, who wasn't sure if the president withheld aid from Ukraine and said doing so would be inappropriate, but not impeachable.'Add in the modestly negative appraisals from the rest of the public, and opinions of the president's conduct on Ukraine look similar to his overall approval rating <U+2015> which has remained underwater but largely stable for much of his time in office.Not all reactions followed party lines.'I believe that Trump is guilty without a doubt, but Republicans have sold their souls and will not find him guilty,' wrote one man, a self-described independent among the 7% of Trump voters who view tying Ukraine aid to investigating the Bidens as impeachable. One of the few Clinton voters to oppose impeachment argued that 'it's a waste of time when the presidential term is almost over.'And not everyone has hardened views about the Ukraine controversy. Roughly a quarter of Americans say they're not sure whether Trump withheld aid to Ukraine in order to exact an investigation of the Bidens, and nearly a fifth are undecided on whether doing so would be appropriate, inappropriate or impeachable.Those with the weakest views are also the least likely to be closely following the story, the survey found. Roughly half of those who are unsure if Trump withheld aid also said they've heard nothing about the impeachment hearings.'People who've followed the hearings are more likely to say their view of the Trump administration worsened (30%) than improved (20%). That's one thing that has shifted since last week, when those numbers were virtually even. The change is largely due to an increased consensus among Clinton voters that the hearings have worsened, rather than simply reaffirmed, their views of the Trump administration.Those who followed the hearings say, 48% to 43%, that Democrats in Congress have been playing politics rather than making a good-faith effort to get to the truth. They say, 51% to 37%, that House Republicans are playing politics.Opinions of Sondland were moderately negative, but largely uncertain: 26% who followed the hearings say they view him favorably, 34% view him unfavorably, and 40% were not sure.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Nov. 20-22 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

It's not easy. And sometimes, it's not even intentional.In one notable instance last month, Giuliani butt-dialed NBC News' Rich Schapiro, leaving him a three-minute message in which the lawyer was heard discussing a need for cash and his frustration with Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate who has emerged as Trump's political foe.In another case reported earlier this month, Salon's Roger Sollenberger said Giuliani mistakenly texted him what seemed to be a password, brushing it off as an accident when alerted to the message.When asked to comment on questions over his 'state of mind,''Giuliani told Nuzzi <U+2015> while trashing her outlet <U+2015> that he's more than capable of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with political heavyweights in Washington.'I am a high functioning human being able to outwork people half my age,' he claimed.

At the center of the allegations is Joe Biden's push as vice president for the firing of Ukraine's former prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, who led a corruption probe of Burisma. Shokin's ouster was supported by the international community, and there is no evidence that Joe Biden was attempting to do his son a favor.'Additionally, in September, it was reported that Shokin's Burisma investigation had been dormant for more than a year ahead of Joe Biden's push for his dismissal.'In fact, Trump's pressure campaign demanding that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky launch an investigation of the Bidens is at the heart of House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.Graham last week requested State Department records related to Joe Biden's efforts to oust the former Ukrainian prosecutor general, prompting Biden's complaint in a CNN interview'on Friday that Graham's investigation was motivated by politics.

The Trump administration has tried to block him and other current and former administration officials from appearing before Congress. The administration quickly announced it would appeal and seek to block Jackson's ruling that McGahn must honor the subpoena.'Stated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings,' Jackson wrote. 'This means that they do not have subjects, bound by loyalty or blood, whose destiny they are entitled to control. Rather, in this land of liberty, it is indisputable that current and former employees of the White House work for the People of the United States, and that they take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Moreover, as citizens of the United States, current and former senior-level presidential aides have constitutional rights, including the right to free speech, and they retain these rights even after they have transitioned back into private life.'The ruling could have an immediate impact on the ongoing impeachment inquiry surrounding Trump's more recent Ukraine scandal. The House Judiciary Committee wants McGahn to testify soon, now that the House Intelligence Committee's public hearings on the Ukraine scandal are winding down.'To make the point as plain as possible, it is clear to this Court ... that, with respect to senior-level presidential aides, absolute immunity from compelled congressional process simply does not exist,' Jackson wrote.'House Democrats subpoenaed McGahn to testify after the second volume of Mueller's report laid out several instances of McGahn refusing to carry out orders he considered inappropriate or illegal. McGahn, according to the Mueller report, told former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus that he would resign because Trump had asked him to 'do crazy shit' like fire Mueller. Trump then tried to get McGahn to deny that Trump had ordered him to get Mueller removed, according to the report.The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, in an opinion signed by Trump appointee Assistant Attorney General Steven Engel, found that the public disclosure of the Mueller report 'does not have any legal bearing upon the force of the congressional subpoena' and that the public disclosure of the report 'did not constitute a general waiver concerning Mr. McGahn's communications with the President on those subjects or any other subjects.'Trump told his former counsel to ignore the subpoena. The House Judiciary Committee sued McGahn back in August, and Jackson heard the case in October. At the October hearing, according to CNN, Jackson said that McGahn's 'status as a former executive branch official' doesn't shield him from giving information. The Trump administration has argued that McGahn has absolute immunity from being forced to comply with a congressional subpoena.Trump told ABC back in June that what McGahn told Mueller 'doesn't matter' and said that McGahn 'wanted to make himself look like a good lawyer.'Since the dispute over McGahn's testimony began seven months ago, the White House has blocked several fact witnesses from testifying about their knowledge of Trump's Ukraine scandal, even as Republicans and White House officials have complained that many of the impeachment inquiry witnesses lacked firsthand knowledge of Trump's actions.'Read the full ruling below.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"280",1454471362,"Federal Investigators Looking Into Rudy Giuliani's Consulting Business: Report","Federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to those connected to Rudy Giuliani and his business associates that reportedly spell out a widespread investigation into potential obstruction of justice, fraud and money laundering.Investigators have sent subpoenas as well as other requests to potential witnesses in the past few weeks seeking records and information related to President Donald Trump's personal attorney and two of Giuliani's associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal in a report published Monday. The Washington Post later also reported'that the subpoenas were issued.The subpoenas, according to the Journal, indicate that prosecutors are investigating Giuliani's consulting work with the entities named in the subpoenas, including Giuliani Partners, his security-consulting firm that had multiple foreign clients, such as a city in Ukraine. The subpoenas also request information on Fraud Guarantee, a company co-founded by Parnas that paid Giuliani $500,000 for business and legal consultations.The subpoenas described to the Journal listed nine potential charges: obstruction of justice, money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the U.S., making false statements to the government, serving as an unregistered foreign agent, donating foreign money, making donations in another person's name, mail fraud and wire fraud.Parnas and Fruman have already been indicted on campaign finance violations in the investigation being led by the FBI and the Southern District of New York. The two Florida businessmen were arrested in October on charges of illegally funneling $325,000 to America First Action, a pro-Trump election committee, and other Republican political candidates. They've pleaded not guilty to the charges.Giuliani hired lawyers earlier this month to represent him as SDNY prosecutors examine his interactions with Parnas and Fruman. The former mayor of New York City said he is now represented by Robert Costello, Eric Creizman and Melissa Madrigal. Giuliani has denied any wrongdoing, though he has not yet been directly accused of a crime.Giuliani is one of the'key players in the House's impeachment investigation into Trump's actions, helping direct the shadow diplomacy in Ukraine that included the withholding of U.S. military aid until Kyiv agreed to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.Trump and Giuliani have repeatedly and falsely accused former Vice President Biden of blocking Ukrainian prosecutors from investigating Burisma, the independent Ukrainian gas company whose board Hunter Biden served on until earlier this year. Both Bidens have denied any wrongdoing, and there is no evidence substantiating the allegations of corruption against them.Parnas and Fruman were part of Giuliani's campaign to convince Ukraine to conduct investigations, helping introduce Trump's personal attorney <U+2015> who has no official position at the White House <U+2015> to Ukrainian officials involved in promoting the unsubstantiated allegations against the Bidens, as well as against Marie Yovanovitch, who was removed as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine as part of a smear campaign.''I didn't understand that at all, because I had never met Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, and so it was unclear to me why <U+2015> why they were interested in <U+2015> in doing this,' Yovanovitch told Congress in her witness testimony.That assistance sometimes mixed with the businessmen's professional interests, including wanting to install new management in Ukraine's huge state-owned gas firm, Naftogaz, in order to then steer lucrative contracts to companies controlled by them.'Since his indictment, Parnas's attorney Joseph Bondy said his client is willing to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry and has reportedly submitted materials to the House Intelligence Committee. Bondy also said Parnas is prepared to tell Congress about how Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking GOP member of the committee, met with former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin to try to find dirt on the Bidens. Nunes has denied the allegations.Giuliani told the Journal on Sunday that he refers clients to registered lobbyists when they ask him to do something related to the Trump administration. He also denied having any business dealings in Ukraine since becoming Trump's lawyer in April 2018.'All they have to do is come and ask me,' he told the Journal of investigators. 'There's obviously a concerted effort to spread as many lies about me as possible, to destroy my reputation so that I'm not credible when I continue to reveal all of the massive evidence of criminality by the Bidens.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"281",1454534239,"Judge Orders Pentagon, White House Budget Office To Release Records On Ukraine Aid","A federal judge on Monday ordered the Pentagon and the White House Office of Management and Budget to release documents related to the delay in military aid to Ukraine.Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, a U.S. district judge for Washington, D.C., issued a preliminary injunction ordering the two agencies to comply with a Freedom of Information Act request for records relating to the Trump administration's freeze on Ukraine aid, which is at the center of the House's impeachment investigation into the president.The judge ordered the agencies to release half of the 211 pages of documents by Dec. 12 and the rest by Dec. 20. The records include communications between the Defense Department, the department's comptroller and the OMB regarding the Pentagon's Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI). The request for the records came from the Center for Public Integrity.Trump froze nearly $400 million of congressionally approved military aid over the summer and lifted the freeze on most of the aid only after a whistleblower from the intelligence community filed a complaint that sparked the impeachment inquiry. The anonymous whistleblower, as well as several witnesses who have testified publicly and privately to Congress, have alleged that Trump withheld the aid in order to pressure Ukraine to investigate a Democratic political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Biden's son Hunter.'Currently, the United States House of Representatives is in the process of conducting impeachment proceedings concerning the same subject matter as the documents requested by Plaintiff,' Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her order. 'As such, the requested documents are sought in order to inform the public on a matter of extreme national concern. Only an informed electorate can develop its opinions and persuasively petition its elected officials to act in ways which further the aims of those opinions.'Republicans throughout the impeachment investigation have argued that Trump and his allies could not have engaged in an attempted quid pro quo with Ukraine because the country was not aware of the frozen military aid until after Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which the two discussed Zelensky launching an investigation of the Bidens. But public testimony last week from Pentagon official Laura Cooper revealed that Ukrainian Embassy staffers were aware at the time of the phone call that U.S. military aid was being held up for some reason.The House subpoenaed documents in October from the Pentagon and the OMB in the impeachment investigation, though the agency heads joined the rest of Trump's allies in refusing to comply with the orders.Currently, $35 million in congressionally approved aid to Ukraine has still not been delivered, according to the Los Angeles Times. The money was reportedly earmarked for grenade launchers, secure communications and naval combat craft, but it has not left the U.S. treasury.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"283",1454739835,"Ex-GOP Congressman Offers Up A Savagely Honest Analysis Of His Old Party","A former Republican'member of Congress has fiercely criticized what his old party has become under President Donald Trump, calling it one 'without conviction' over its members' willingness to push disinformation spread by Russia's security services'that it was Ukraine and not Russia that interfered in the 2016 election.'Republican senators, Republican members of Congress tonight are being used by Russia because they are unwilling to look at the truth,' former Rep. David Jolly'(R-Fla.) said on MSNBC's 'The Last Word.'Jolly explained how, during his time on the Hill in the '90s before he became a lawmaker, he had argued for the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton 'because I believed in a certain law and order principle that a president shouldn't engage in perjury or obstruction of justice and I thought I belonged to a party that agreed with that.'He had also later argued against former President Barack Obama's executive order on the'Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program because 'I thought I belonged to a party that opposed that on constitutional grounds.'But 'in retrospect, what I've learned these last three years is it wasn't a law and order party, just a party that hated Bill Clinton,' said Jolly, who served in the House from 2014 to 2017 and announced his resignation from the GOP in October 2018.''It wasn't a constitutional party when Barack Obama was in office,' he added. 'It was just a party that hated Barack Obama.'Jolly said 'what we're seeing now is a party that is embracing Donald Trump because they have a quest for power, proximity for power and they want within their reach the ability to self-deal. This is a party today without conviction and they are willing to be used by Russians.''We put our trust in our elected leaders,' he concluded.

"284",1455022635,"‘Watchmen’ Is A Powerful Exploration Of Black Trauma —  And Everyone Needs To Watch","This article contains spoilers for 'Watchmen' Season 1, Episode 6.'At the start of 'Watchmen' Episode 6, Agent Laurie Blake leans in closely to get through to a hazy Angela Abar. Portrayed masterfully by Regina King, Abar has just ingested a 'lethal dose of Nostalgia,' and she is close to slipping into a coma.'You shouldn't have swallowed your grandfather's pills, Angela,' Blake says, before explaining how the capsules work. Nostalgia was intended for the elderly and people with dementia. Her grandfather's memories had been harvested and turned into pill form. With these edible memories, he would never forget his past and would pass the memories on to his descendants.'Who wants to be in the present when you can live in the past?' Blake (Jean Smart) asks incredulously and, perhaps, rhetorically. For Abar, living in the past means reliving several life-altering events experienced by her grandfather Will Reeves (Louis Gossett Jr.): the horrors of racial terror, white supremacy in the police force, the abandonment of family and a near-death encounter. For the 'Watchmen' audience, it also means being transported back in time to finally see the great reveal, one that many fans saw coming. Reeves is Hooded Justice, a Black superhero who assaults and kills criminals, racists and rogue police officers in the streets of New York City. Abar is continuing her grandfather's crime-fighting legacy ' and she didn't even know it.'Watchmen' has asked a lot of its viewers to parse through storylines that leave questions unanswered, to relive traumatic moments from our nation's history, to confront racism in the guise of a superhero series. In doing so, the HBO show treats white supremacy as a villain of a not-so-distant past, one embedded in present-day institutions and familial histories that inform our day-to-day lives. Sunday's episode, in particular, is a brilliant and timely look at how generations of Americans have confronted this country's ugly history with racism and how Black families today have been affected by the racial terror of generations past.The series reimagines the 1986 graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. Where the protagonists of that iteration fought against the threat of nuclear war with the Soviet Union, showrunner Damon Lindelof and executive producer Nicole Kassell turned the focus of this version to race. That backdrop was immediately clear in the premiere, in which Lindelof and Kassell re-staged the Tulsa Race Massacre, when hundreds of Black residents were killed in 1921 by white mobs in the Greenwood neighborhood, a bustling Black community. The scene introduced millions of viewers to the tragedy.'To me, 'Watchmen' is a story about America, and it's about self-proclaimed 'heroes' fighting an intangible enemy that is almost impossible to defeat,' Lindelof wrote on Instagram. 'In the '80s, that enemy was the pervasive threat of nuclear Armageddon between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. In 2019, that enemy is the long overdue reckoning with our country's camouflaged history of white supremacy.'Episode 6, titled 'The Extraordinary Being,' is rendered in mostly black and white. Under the influence of Nostalgia, Abar is first transported to 1938, when her grandfather was inducted into the New York Police Department as one of the few Black officers on the force. Several of his fellow officers are members of Cyclops, a KKK conspiracy group, who flash an OK sign reminiscent of the salute for present-day white supremacists. Reeves arrests a white man named Fred for setting a Jewish delicatessen on fire, only to find that his white colleagues later released him. The white officers quickly realize Reeves is on a mission to call out wrongdoings on the force.'That power imbalance ' a Black man infiltrating their white boys' club ''is the same kind of narrative that sparked thousands of lynchings in the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries. Civil rights activist and journalist Ida B. Wells wrote in her journal that she saw lynchings as white peoples' way 'to get rid of Negroes who were acquiring wealth and property and thus keep the race terrorized and 'the n<U+2015><U+2015>r down.'' (Wells' impact as an anti-lynching crusader is subtly woven through the episode; Reeves' wife, June, is a journalist for the New York Amsterdam News, and a portrait of Wells hangs in the Reeveses' home.) In Tulsa; Rosewood, Florida; and Elaine, Arkansas, all marked by racist massacres, Black residents lived in enclaves that promoted prosperity and strength. In Elaine, at least 200 Black people were killed 100 years ago this year, after false rumors spread that Black sharecroppers were planning an uprising against white neighbors.'The episode is marked by a harrowing scene in which a young Will Reeves (Jovan Adepo) is strung up by fellow police officers with a noose. Audiences witness the moment through the perspective of Reeves and see racial terror from the viewpoint of its victims. And Angela, still in her Nostalgia haze, experiences it, too.'For executive producer Stephen Williams, who directed Episode 6, it was important to appropriately address the ugly history of lynchings and not be exploitative. The scene with Reeves was filmed in Macon, Georgia, in Bibb County, where there were seven reported lynchings between 1877 and 1950. There were 594 reported racial terror lynchings in the state of Georgia during that same time, and more than 4,000 across 20 states, according to the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit organization working to end racial inequality.Williams visited EJI's Legacy Museum in Montgomery, Alabama, which is dedicated to exploring slavery, lynching, segregation and mass incarceration in America. The museum is blocks away from the national memorial to victims of racial terror.'We really try to put the viewer in the actual subjective experience of what that terror must have felt like,' Williams, who worked with Lindelof on 'Lost,' told HuffPost. 'So standing there on that ground in the South where these events actually took place not that long ago, and trying to authentically and truthfully and honestly depict an event like that was something I will never forget.'The episode was co-written by Lindelof and journalist-turned-TV-writer Cord Jefferson. Jefferson, who has written for 'Succession,' 'The Good Place,' 'Master of None' and other popular TV series, said his journalism background helped him and other writers be 'thoughtful and interrogative about these big ideas we've attempted to address in the show: reparations, racial violence, transgenerational trauma, etc.''This episode ' about the wounds that haunt a person and the way you can unwittingly transfer your wounds to others ' had great significance for me,' Jefferson told HuffPost. 'I hope others might feel the same.'As a survivor of the Tulsa Race Massacre, Reeves carries with him the anger that often follows victims of tragedy. He doesn't want to confront the past, and that's why 'he's so goddamned angry,' June (Danielle Deadwyler) tells him.Kimberly Ellis, who hosts discussions about the Tulsa Race Massacre across the country, said seeing a television show share this tragedy with millions of viewers 'is an unparalleled type of storytelling in the modern era.' Like Jefferson, she sees the importance of shedding light on multigenerational trauma within Black families who are descendants of racial terror.'In the story of the Tulsa tragedy of 1921, we have an extremely physical and tangible representation of trauma passed down intergenerationally,' Ellis, an author, speaker and producer, told HuffPost. 'There was the physical trauma of complete and total displacement for many families who lived in Red Cross tents for months following the domestic terror and many others who may have returned and/or rebuilt but who could not re-create the generational wealth they had previously established.'She also said that the 'culture of silence' between generations is harmful to young people, who don't realize how generational wealth has been stolen from them. Brenda Alford, whose grandparents survived the Tulsa massacre, told WBUR earlier this year that her family owned a shoe shop, record store, dance pavilion and skating rink in the Greenwood district. The businesses were burned down in the riots ' and for many years, the story was swept under the rug.'Our community was not able to pass on generational wealth,' Alford told WBUR. 'I watched in my time my uncle, my grandfather's son, who followed his footsteps and got his degree in shoemaking, I watched as he tried to restart the business in the '70s and was unable to do it. And we saw the effects it had on him. It was absolutely horrible.'For all that 'Watchmen' expertly does to explore America's history, the series also reckons with our current moment in politics and culture.'The episode slips in real-life references to present-day figures: Fred, the racist man Reeves arrested, has the same name as President Donald Trump's father, who owned a grocery store in Queens in the '30s. This year marked the first time Congress considered a bill to create a commission to study the effects of slavery and consider reparations for African Americans. And we are just shy of a year since the federal government recognized lynching as a federal crime. In October, Donald Trump referred to the House impeachment inquiry as a 'lynching' and reignited the debate that using the word as a metaphor erases America's history of racist violence.The symbolism of the noose ' which was dissected time and time again during the infamous Jussie Smollett saga earlier this year, when he alleged he was the victim of a hate crime ' persists today as it shows up on college campuses and in'places of employment to threaten Black lives. (The episode, Jefferson told HuffPost, was written long before Smollett's story made headlines.)'The idea that a hood and noose could represent a signature look for a vigilante against white supremacy is probably the most radical reimagining of historically racist symbols on TV ever. And that Old Man Reeves wears a hoodie is the perfect homage to Trayvon Martin and the Black Lives Matter movement that formed after racist vigilante George Zimmerman was acquitted of all charges in the death of the unarmed 17-year-old in Florida.'You ain't gon' get justice with a badge, Will Reeves,' June tells him after he is attacked by his colleagues. 'You gon' get it with that hood.'In the final scene of the episode, Reeves sits in his wheelchair after luring Police Chief Judd Crawford to a tree in the middle of the night.''You have a Klan robe in your closet,' Reeves says.'My granddad's,' Crawford says. 'I have a right to keep it; it's my legacy.''If you're so proud of your legacy, why do you hide it?' Reeves asks, before shining a mesmerizing flashlight on Crawford and convincing him to hang himself.Indeed, Hooded Justice would shine a light on the truth, one that his memory would never let him forget.",2019-11-26 05:45:14

The announcement of the hearing comes after the House Intelligence Committee held fact-finding hearings about Trump's alleged plot to withhold millions in aid to Ukraine until the country announced an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, whom Trump saw as a chief political rival.'At base, the President has a choice to make: he can take this opportunity to be represented in the impeachment hearings, or he can stop complaining about the process,' said Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, in a statement.

Earlier this week, a federal judge ruled that former White House counsel Don McGahn had to testify before Congress, a decision which could impact other congressional subpoenas.But the Trump administration has appealed, and a Democratic aide said that if they simply waited for the judicial process to play out, the administration would be successful in interfering in the congressional investigation.Read the full letter to Trump below.This is a developing story.

"288",1455443089,"Trump Was Aware Of Whistleblower Complaint Before He Unfroze Ukraine Aid: Report","President Donald Trump was told that a whistleblower had filed a complaint about his call with the leader of Ukraine several weeks before he unfroze nearly $400 million in military aid to the country, The New York Times reported Tuesday.The latest details add more context to the president's decision-making in the days after he sought to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open an investigation into a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter. Trump's behavior on the July 25 call has become the crux of Democrats''impeachment investigation, which moved into the public earlier this month as a parade of current and former officials testified openly about their knowledge of the call.The whistleblower, an anonymous intelligence officer, filed the complaint with the intelligence community's inspector general in mid-August, saying he was troubled that the president may have delayed the military aid in order to force Zelensky to open the Biden investigation. Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company until earlier this year, although neither he nor his father has been accused of any wrongdoing.Critics have cast the pressure campaign as a clear demand for a political favor in exchange for White House action, although Trump has vehemently rejected that characterization and said repeatedly the call was 'perfect.'Trump eventually released the $391 million in military aid in early September after a bipartisan group of lawmakers objected to its holdup and Democrats launched an investigation into the supposed demands. The Times noted that it's unclear how much of the complaint the president knew about before he released the funds.The Times, which cited two people familiar with Trump's knowledge of the call, noted two White House lawyers told the president a whistleblower had accused him of wrongdoing in late August. The complaint would usually be submitted to congressional lawmakers who oversee the intelligence community, but the attorneys, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his deputy, John Eisenberg, determined that the administration could keep it under wraps. They also asked the Justice Department if they could withhold the complaint, and the agency's Office of Legal Counsel agreed.However, Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community inspector general, determined it should be handed over to Congress, setting off a tussle over the contents of the complaint. It became public in September, and Trump later released a reconstruction of his call with Zelensky in an attempt to clear his name. The document, however, included several instances in which the president pressured his counterpart for investigations, including the line: 'Do us a favor, though' while discussing the military aid.The president and his allies have been scrambling to contain the fallout from the ongoing impeachment inquiry into his behavior for weeks, particularly after officials began testifying in public hearings earlier this month. Last week, Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, said explicitly that there was a clear demand for a quid pro quo when Trump spoke with Zelensky, saying he 'followed the president's orders' to get the Ukrainians to pursue the investigations.'I know that members of this committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a quid pro quo?' Sondland said during his testimony last week. 'As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes. Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret.'Many administration officials with direct knowledge of the demands, however, have refused to testify as the White House has moved to resist demands it comply with the House inquiry.Republicans in Congress have remained steadfast behind the president throughout the process, accusing Democrats of trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"289",1455445490,"Trump Denies Directing Rudy Giuliani To Conduct Ukraine Shadow Diplomacy","President Donald Trump denied Tuesday that he sent his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine in order to pressure the country's government to conduct investigations into his political rivals, which is at the center of the House's impeachment investigation into the president.In an interview with former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, Trump said he did not tell Giuliani to conduct a shadow diplomacy channel to Ukraine. The radio interview was on O'Reilly's premium streaming service on his website.'No, I didn't direct him, but he is a warrior, he is a warrior,' Trump told O'Reilly.When O'Reilly asked the president what Giuliani was doing in Ukraine on his behalf, Trump said, 'you have to ask that to Rudy.''Rudy has other clients other than me,' Trump said, adding that he knew his personal attorney was going to Ukraine at one point but canceled the trip.LISTEN: President Trump is now distancing himself more than ever from lawyer Rudy Giuliani, claiming he did not direct Giuliani to act on his behalf in Ukraine in a new interview with Bill O'Reilly. pic.twitter.com/6JaP9oOLMIThe statement contradicts public claims from Giuliani'that he conducted an investigation 'concerning 2016 Ukrainian collusion and corruption' on Trump's behalf. Giuliani, along with several Trump allies, was working with Ukraine to get them to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 presidential election instead of Russia.'Giuliani's lawyer said Tuesday night that his client 'never went to Ukraine for any probe' and that any information he received was given to him during former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, 'before Biden was even announced,' according to Bloomberg.Trump's claim to O'Reilly also contradicts the White House summary of Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he asked his Ukrainian counterpart to link up with Giuliani to go forward with investigating the Bidens. The call is an important aspect of the impeachment inquiry as the House looks into whether Trump's reason for withholding nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine was to pressure Zelensky to agree to investigate the Bidens, creating an attempted quid pro quo.Multiple witnesses in the House's impeachment investigation have also testified that Giuliani directed a shadow U.S. diplomacy in Ukraine with the goal of pressuring the country to publicly announce investigations that Trump wanted. Republican donor and Trump-appointed U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, one of the key players in the impeachment inquiry, testified that the president gave him 'express direction' to work with Giuliani on pressuring Ukraine to conduct investigations.Earlier this month, Giuliani told Fox News' Ed Henry that he has a 'very, very good relationship' with the president and that, addressing rumors Trump is going to 'throw him under the bus,' responded, 'He isn't, but I have insurance.' The attorney also told the Guardian he has 'very, very good insurance' and that 'all my hospital bills will be paid.''The former New York mayor later said that the comments were 'sarcastic' and that they related to 'the files in my safe' on the Bidens.Federal prosecutors are investigating Giuliani and two of his business associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, in relation to their activities in Ukraine. Subpoenas issued to those connected to the three reportedly spell out a widespread investigation into nine potential charges, including obstruction of justice, fraud and money laundering, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post reported on Monday. The subpoenas indicate that prosecutors are investigating Giuliani's consulting work, though the attorney has denied any criminal wrongdoing.Giuliani defied a House subpoena in October from lawmakers seeking documents related to his involvement in the Ukraine scandal. His attorney at the time, Jon Sale, told Congress in a letter that the subpoena was 'beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry' and called the impeachment investigation 'baseless' and 'unconstitutional.''The House Judiciary Committee will hold its first impeachment hearing Dec. 4 and has informed Trump of his rights in the process in a letter. That announcement came after the House Intelligence Committee held several public and private fact-finding hearings about the Ukraine scandal.This article has been updated with a comment from Giuliani's lawyer.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"291",1456138645,"Giuliani Pursued Contracts With Ukrainian Prosecutor While Pushing Biden Probe: Reports","Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, pursued contracts with Ukrainian officials worth hundreds of thousands of dollars while simultaneously seeking political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden for Trump's benefit, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Wednesday.As he waged a public campaign accusing Biden of corruption in Ukraine, Giuliani earlier this year was privately negotiating business deals with Yuri Lutsenko <U+2015> Ukraine's top prosecutor at the time <U+2015> and the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice, according to documents obtained by the Post and the Times.Joseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing, a Washington husband-and-wife legal team with ties to Trump, were also listed on some of the documents as people who would receive payment from the Ukrainian government.One such document <U+2015> a draft of a legal agreement from mid-February <U+2015> called for Lutsenko to pay Giuliani Partners $200,000 to retain Giuliani, diGenova and Toensing. Per the agreement, Giuliani would help Lutsenko recover money he believed had been stolen from the Ukrainian government.Giuliani on Wednesday defended the negotiations in a series of text messages.'It was not a strict conflict but it could be too much for me to do,' Giuliani told HuffPost about his apparent decision not to finalize the contracts.''Got paid ZERO,' he added.'As the Times noted, Giuliani met with Lutsenko in New York weeks earlier to discuss Biden, the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, and Biden's son Hunter, who was a member of Burisma's board for several years until April.Giuliani, Trump and his congressional supporters have accused Biden, when he was vice president, of demanding the firing of Ukraine's then-top prosecutor Viktor Shokin for the purpose of impeding an investigation into Burisma.There is no evidence to support this claim, as Lutsenko has said himself. What's more, Shokin was not pursuing an investigation into Burisma and a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers also supported Shokin's removal.In March, another agreement reportedly showed that the Ukraine Ministry of Justice would retain diGenova and Toensing for representation, but that Lutsenko's office would pay Giuliani Partners the $300,000 fee.A later version of the proposal reportedly did not reference Giuliani.None of the agreements were executed and there's no indication that Giuliani was paid by Lutsenko or the Ukrainian government, the Post reported.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky fired Lutsenko in August, and Ukrainian authorities said in October that they had opened a criminal investigation into him over allegedly abusing his power in dealings with politicians.Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, in which the U.S. president pushed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and the debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine <U+2015> not Russia <U+2015> hacked the Democratic National Committee's servers in 2016, was the subject of a whistleblower complaint, which prompted the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Giuliani bristled when asked how Biden's son getting paid by a foreign company for access to his father differed from Giuliani getting paid by a foreign government seeking access to his client, Trump.'I'm a lawyer for 50 years and would bring a civil case for them,' Giuliani texted HuffPost, before referencing Hunter Biden's history of drug problems. 'I was completely qualified on the merits, it had nothing to do with government and I didn't do it, he did for 4 years, I was paid nothing and he was paid at least 5m 3m (sic) in laundered money.'Giuliani referred to HuffPost as a 'virulent Trump hating publication' that was 'so completely removed from reality.'Mark Corallo,'a representative for diGenova and Toensing's law firm, told the Times that their firm 'always stated that we agreed to represent Ukrainian whistle-blowers.''No money was ever received and no legal work was ever performed,' Corallo said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"292",1456250489,"The Way People Follow The News Has Changed A Lot Since Watergate","When the Senate Watergate Committee televised its hearings on the Watergate scandal in 1973, 70% of Americans told Gallup they'd watched at least some of the proceedings live on television.'A' HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted during the hearings into impeaching President Trump highlight how the national media environment has fractured in the decades since <U+2015> an additional hurdle for those hoping the testimony would dramatically shift public opinion. This and'other recent surveys have found that support for impeachment, after rising earlier this fall, didn't change much during the course of the hearings.It's not that the testimony didn't attract widespread attention: 78% of the public said they'd followed news about the hearings to at least some extent. But only four in 10 say they'd watched even some parts of the actual hearings. Another 38% saw clips, highlights or news stories analyzing the proceedings, while 22% hadn't heard anything at all.''If Americans have devoured past live hearings in Washington, following each dramatic twist and turn, many seemed only to nibble and graze' on the Trump impeachment hearings, the AP's Stephen Groves and Tamara Lush wrote as the hearings kicked off. 'They scanned headlines on their phones, read social media posts or clicked on snippets of video pushed out online'. The fractured and filtered way the country consumed the testimony ' and all news ' may have consequences.'In 1973, Americans could watch the Watergate hearings in full on PBS, or catch rotating coverage across the broadcast networks. This time, the potential sources are far more varied. Forty-three percent of those who followed the hearings said they'd gotten at least some of their news about impeachment from a cable network, 39% from local TV news, 36% online, 32% from national TV on a broadcast network, and 28% from social media. Fewer named print media or a conversation with someone else as a source.(A few caveats on the data: Because more civically engaged people are more likely to take surveys, and because people sometimes overstate their own degree of political awareness, all these numbers may be, if anything, a little high. Because the HuffPost/YouGov survey was conducted online, and framed the question somewhat differently, any comparison with historical data isn't entirely apples-to-apples.)There are some political divides on who has been following the impeachment story, and how they've chosen to do so. Trump's opponents, notably, were the most likely to be following along in real-time: Democrats were 18 points likelier than Republicans to say they'd watched at least part of the hearings, rather than watching highlights or reading articles later. And while similar shares in each party reported following the news on cable, they chose different sources: 82% of Republicans who followed the hearings on cable said they relied on Fox for at least some coverage, with just 22% saying they'd watched CNN, and 15% that they'd tuned into MSNBC. By contrast, 62% of Democrats who followed the hearings on cable said they'd watched CNN and 61% said that they'd watched MSNBC, with just 18% looking at Fox.But the poll also highlights the divide between the most politically active Americans and those who are less focused. Only half of Americans say that news and current events matter a lot in their daily life, with the rest finding current events irrelevant, or saying they're not sure. Just a quarter of Americans said they'd paid a lot of attention to the news last Wednesday, a day that included both Gordon Sondland's testimony in the impeachment hearings and a Democratic primary debate. Only 35% said the news that day seemed even somewhat busier than average.Those people who haven't yet reached a conclusion about impeachment are particularly unlikely to be paying much attention. In the HuffPost/YouGov survey, 13% of Americans said that they weren't sure whether or not Trump should be impeached. Among that group, just a fifth said the news was relevant to their lives, and only 10% that they'd paid a lot of attention to the news Wednesday. Only 13% had caught any of the hearings.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Nov. 20-22 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

"293",1456288239,"Multiple Women Recall Sexual Misconduct And Retaliation By Gordon Sondland","By Julia Silverman, Kelly Clarke, and Fiona McCann, Portland Monthly, with Maryam Jameel and Doris BurkeProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive'our biggest stories'as soon as they're published.This article was co-published with'Portland Monthly.Three women say they faced sexual misconduct by Gordon Sondland before he was the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and at the center of the presidential impeachment inquiry. They say he retaliated against them professionally after they rejected his advances.In one case, a potential business partner recalls that Sondland took her to tour a room in a hotel he owns, only to then grab her face and try to kiss her. After she rejected him, Sondland backtracked on investing in her business.Another woman, a work associate at the time, says Sondland exposed himself to her during a business interaction. She also recalls falling over the back of a couch trying to get away from him. After she made her lack of interest clear, she says Sondland called her, screaming about her job performance.A third woman, 27 years Sondland's junior, met him to discuss a potential job. She says he pushed himself against her and kissed her. She shoved him away. She says his job help stopped.All three women have agreed to be named in this story. In all the cases, friends, family members or colleagues of the women recall being told about the encounters at the time. The cases span a seven-year period, ending less than a decade ago. Sondland denies the allegations.'In decades of my career in business and civic affairs, my conduct can be affirmed by hundreds of employees and colleagues with whom I have worked in countless circumstances,' Sondland said in a statement. 'These untrue claims of unwanted touching and kissing are concocted and, I believe, coordinated for political purposes. They have no basis in fact, and I categorically deny them.' (Read his'statement.)Sondland's lawyer added in a letter: 'Notably, what each of these three women share in common is that they pursued Ambassador Sondland for financial and personal gain ' an investment, a job, and insurance brokerage work ' and he declined their proposals.'The lawyer, Jim McDermott, also wrote that the three women are trying to undermine Sondland's latest testimony. 'Given the timing of your intended story, a reasonable conclusion to be drawn is that you are attempting to affect Ambassador Sondland's credibility as a fact witness in the pending impeachment inquiry,' McDermott wrote. 'Given the politically charged climate in which current events are unfolding, some might consider this to be veiled witness tampering.'Reporting on this story began in October, around the time of Sondland's initial impeachment testimony, in which he backed the president's assertion that there was no quid pro quo involving Ukraine.The day after Sondland gave that testimony, Nicole Vogel spoke at the Day of the Girl Luncheon in Seattle, an event hosted by a regional nonprofit, Girls Inc., whose'mission'is to inspire 'all girls to be strong, smart, and bold.' Vogel decided to recount her Sondland story and name him.Vogel also mentioned it to an editor at Portland Monthly, the co-publisher of this story, and she later spoke about it again at a breakfast event in Portland.[Editor's note: Vogel is the owner of Portland Monthly. Vogel cooperated with the story as a source. She was not involved in editorial decisions. The magazine's editorial team decided to partner with ProPublica to independently report her story.]'There were a lot of indecent proposals when I was raising capital, but none as brazen as his,' Vogel recalls. She encountered Sondland 16 years ago when she was trying to raise money to start her magazine. 'I have nothing to say about what he did or didn't do [involving Ukraine]. But if people are asking what his moral character is, I have one more piece of evidence for them.'The women had kept their stories to their own circles, even after Sondland was nominated and vetted for an ambassadorship by a president who himself has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 20 women. The women say they were not contacted by the government for any background checks.In 2003, Vogel had an idea to start a magazine with her journalist brother that would chronicle Portland's exploding art, culture and food scenes. She was 34 years old and fresh off a job at Move.com. Armed with full mock-ups of the magazine and detailed financial projections, the search for investors led her to Sondland.Sondland has long been a power player in Portland, where he is one of the region's most prominent business figures. He owns five hotels in Portland under the umbrella of the company he founded, Provenance Hotel Group. He was once asked at a panel why he got into the business. 'It combines all the elements that give me a reason to get up in the morning,' Sondland'said. 'You have food, you have wine, you have design, you have art, you have intrigue, you have sex. You have everything you can think of.'Sondland is also a prominent philanthropist. He has served on several high-profile nonprofit boards, including as the chairman of the board of trustees of the Portland Art Museum. A prominent staircase there bears his name and that of his wife, Katherine Durant.According to Vogel, Sondland was helpful, connecting her with potential advertisers and investors. Then, in the spring of 2003, he invited her to dinner at El Gaucho, a clubby, old-school steakhouse, requesting information on the business's projected financials. Over dinner, he told her that he would invest his own money in the magazine, and that Portland needed people like her.'Gordon had said that night that he was going to invest,' Vogel recalls. 'And in fact, he said to me that he was interested in investing in the company, but that he was more interested in investing in me, because he felt as if Portland didn't keep people of high ambition and talent.'After dinner, Vogel remembers Sondland proposing a walk across the street to Hotel Lucia, which Provenance had acquired two years before and filled with splashy art. Vogel says he introduced her to staff on the first floor ' the concierge, the doorman, the front desk attendants ' before suggesting that she might want to see one of the rooms.In Vogel's memory, the room was small and mundane, but she made admiring comments before turning to open the door and let herself out when Sondland's voice stopped her.'I remember seeing my hand drop from the door handle,' she says. 'I turned around, and he's standing right behind me, and he says, 'Can I just have a hug first?''So she did the only thing she could think of to ensure a safe exit, giving him a hearty-back-pat-we're-all-friends-here hug.'And as I pulled back, he grabs my face and goes to kiss me.'Vogel deflected the kiss and brought out a well-practiced line, designed, she says, to preserve his ego: 'I said, 'Ooh Gordon, you're a married man, and you'd just break my heart.'' She left through the hotel lobby, making sure to say goodbye to everyone she'd been introduced to, so they'd all remember that she hadn't been upstairs for more than a few minutes.Shortly after, Vogel's records show, Sondland emailed her requesting a financial analysis for her business plan. He included a brief aside: 'Sorry I was such a dud.'Afterward, Vogel confided in a friend, Craig Sweitzer, and her sister, both of whom confirmed her account. 'I think she was just exhausted,' Lorrie Vogel says. 'All you're trying to do is raise funding for something, and you're appalled that people would use their power to try and take advantage of you.'Sondland and Vogel had a second lunch on the calendar for a few weeks later to hammer out details of the investment. Vogel says she decided to keep the appointment, hoping the encounter at the Lucia had been a momentary lapse in judgment.Vogel and Sondland had offices in the same neighborhood, Portland's trendy Pearl District, which is full of warehouses-turned-galleries, shops and many restaurants. Instead of going to lunch there, Vogel recalls Sondland showed up in a vintage convertible and drove them to an out-of-the-way restaurant 8 miles away, across two rivers.Vogel remembers little of the meal itself, but she recalls the drive back well. She says Sondland placed his hand on her midthigh and left it there for 10 or so minutes. She clamped her own hand on top of his so he couldn't move it any farther up her thigh. They spent the rest of the ride in silence.'God, I would love to have told him to shove it. To have kneed him in the balls,' she says. 'But I didn't do that. It was precarious.' She knew that having her fledgling magazine in Sondland's hotel rooms, reaching thousands of guests, would boost readership numbers and ad rates.Then, just days before she was due to close her first round of financing, Sondland sent an email, changing the terms on his investment.'Nicole,' Sondland's email began. 'After further reflection on this opportunity, I have come to the definite conclusion that this will be a 'labor of love' investment, at least at the beginning. In checking further, I have determined that the Lucia cannot participate under your very creative structure.'Sondland's lawyer disputes that the turnabout was motivated by anything other than business. 'A decision not to invest cannot fairly be characterized as retaliation,' McDermott wrote. 'Ambassador Sondland, in fact, conducted lengthy due diligence about Ms. Vogel's investment proposal that included enlisting analyses from other regional publishers, before deciding not to invest.'Vogel says that Sondland had been planning to put in at least $25,000, her minimum required investment. That money would have allowed Vogel to reach her business plan's goal of $300,000. Instead, Sondland said in the email that he would commit to $10,000 and would only do so if Vogel raised an extra $100,000.Vogel says she ended up emptying her own bank account to make up for Sondland's reversal, and the magazine went forward without him. Today, she runs magazines in six states.In his letter denying the women's accounts, Sondland's lawyer wrote:As you are doubtless aware, one of the three complainants, Nicole Vogel, is the owner and publisher of the Portland Monthly. She and her publication stand to benefit directly from publishing these allegations, and Ms. Vogel's delay in bringing these forward ' even as Ambassador Sondland was undergoing public scrutiny by Congress as part of his confirmation in 2018 ' casts grave doubt on her credibility. Indeed, we understand that Portland Monthly is under significant financial pressure and Ms. Vogel's efforts seem designed to salvage it.Vogel says the only reason she has shared her story is because 'it feels like the right thing to do.' Vogel adds that she 'can't imagine a scenario where there is a financial benefit to Portland Monthly from this story.' The magazine, which Vogel says has been profitable this year, was long placed in rooms in Sondland's hotels in both Portland and Seattle. Vogel says she decided last week to stop placing the magazines there. Halting that arrangement hurts the magazine's reach, says the magazine's publisher.Sondland's attorney also wrote:You should know that Ms. Vogel is a close associate of Rep. Earl Blumenauer who has maligned Ambassador Sondland and threatened his company, misconduct that is now the subject of a Congressional Ethics Office complaint. Congressman Blumenauer is also a vocal critic of the Trump Administration.Vogel says she has no relationship with the congressman. Blumenauer did occasionally contribute to the magazine, which is cited on one of Vogel's'pages'on the website. The ethics complaint was filed by Provenance in response to Blumenauer calling for a boycott of Sondland's company. The congressman did this after Sondland initially declined to testify in the impeachment inquiry. When Sondland did ultimately testify publicly, undercutting the president's defense, Blumenauer'praised'him.<U+2015> <U+2015>Jana Solis met Sondland in 2008. Solis, who went by Janice Schnabel at the time, worked as a hospitality safety engineer for New York City-based insurance giant Marsh & McLennan, creating risk management plans and evaluating the safety of restaurants and hotels. The executive also sometimes pitched clients to sign with the company. (Solis initially misremembered the year she met Sondland as 2003 or 2004. She reviewed her records after Sondland's lawyer noted that Marsh's work with Provenance started in 2008.)Knowing that Solis had experience in the hotel industry, a colleague asked her to take a meeting with Sondland, a lunch at Pazzo Ristorante, the Italian mainstay at what was then the Hotel Vintage Plaza.'He was flirting through the lunch, and ends up just saying, 'OK, I've heard enough,'' Solis remembers. ''You're hired. Congratulations. You're my new hotel chick.''Then, on the way out, Solis recalls that Sondland suddenly 'slap[ped] me on the ass and said, 'I look forward to working with you.'''Sondland's lawyer wrote that Sondland rejects that account: 'Ambassador Sondland denies slapping Ms. Solis on the rear end.'Next, Sondland requested she visit his home, so that she could evaluate his personal art collection. Solis wasn't trained in art valuations, but she agreed to go to his home, she says, to keep the business account intact. She was tough, she figured, after years spent working in industries like manufacturing.The two toured Sondland's home in Portland's exclusive West Hills, Solis making notes about the artwork as the hotelier showed off pictures of himself with then-President George W. Bush and Bush's dog. And then, she recalls, he told her there was even more of his collection to see in the pool house. She'd meet him there, she said, excusing herself both to go to the bathroom and map out a potential exit strategy.'I get out to the pool house, and he is now naked from the waist down,' Solis remembers. 'He said something about, 'I thought we could chat.' And I said something, trying to keep his ego intact ' not that he needed that, not that it wouldn't have been anyway ' I said something like, 'I can't have'that'conversation.''Solis remembers apologizing, saying she was sorry if she'd given Sondland the wrong impression. She wanted to preserve the business relationship and not jeopardize her senior position at a job she loved. Also, he was her ride home: 'I thought, 'I need to keep myself intact and get out,'' she recalls. 'So that's what you do, apologize.''So he's like, 'Well, I just thought we could have some fun, but you know, it's cool.''Sondland put his pants back on. Then he drove her back to downtown Portland, but not before, in Solis' memory, he made one more request: 'Can I have a hug?'It wasn't Solis' last encounter with Sondland. A few months later, she was tasked with inspecting and holding staff training sessions at his hotel properties, including the Roosevelt Hotel in Seattle (now renamed the Hotel Theodore), where Sondland keeps a penthouse apartment.'And the last day I was there doing the training, he said, 'I need you to see the penthouse as well.'' She didn't know it was his private living quarters.'So I'm acting very professional, and I'm going over some of the things I think he needs to deal with [as part of my inspection] and just trying to stay down that road. [He says:] 'Have a drink. Thanks for all you've done this week.''Solis remembers sitting on the couch with him, having a glass of wine and hoping as hard as she could ' praying ' that it would go no further.'The next thing I know, he's all over me,' she recalls. 'He's on top of me. He's kissing me, shoving his tongue down my throat. And I'm trying to wiggle out from under him, and the next thing you know, I'm sort of rising up to get away from him, and I fall over the back of the couch.'She remembers suddenly finding herself on the floor. 'And I'm like: 'Gordon, I'm not sure what else to say. You know, I really, really want to do business with you, but I'm not sure we can. I don't know what your issues are, but I am telling you, I cannot make them mine.''Sondland's lawyer says the ambassador denies that happened. 'Ambassador Sondland also denies exposing himself to her or forcibly kissing her,' he wrote. 'We have been able to review Provenance's records interacting with Ms. Solis's company, and at no time did she or her employer convey any concern about Ambassador Sondland, his comportment, or the nature of any business dealings he had with them or their personnel.'Solis' former husband, Kevin Schnabel, recalls Solis was upset when she arrived home from that trip. 'One of the things that always stuck in my head is her comment that he literally had his tongue down [her] throat, [and as she was] trying to get away from him she had fallen over the back of the couch,' Schnabel remembers. Solis also told Schnabel her recollection of what happened in the pool house.A few days later, Solis was back in her office, working late, when the phone rang. She recalls Sondland was on the other end, screaming at her over insurance issues tangential to her job. 'At the end of the day, it wasn't about insurance. He was pissed. He didn't get his way [with me], and he was making it about work,' she says. 'And he was making it all my fault.'Alone at her desk, Solis started to sob. She says a colleague found her there; he'd heard Sondland's screams on the speakerphone from his office. The colleague, who declined to be named, says he saw the incident. She 'became emotional,' he says, 'and concerned about what Marsh would think if [she] lost the account over the matter.'It was the last time Solis ever spoke with Sondland. Solis left the account. Provenance is currently a client of Marsh. Today, she still works in the insurance industry and often travels the country as a speaker and leader in her industry.Sondland's lawyer provided an email that one of Solis' colleagues at her current firm sent to Provenance in 2016 pitching them on business. The colleague wrote that he had been referred by Solis.Solis says she didn't know about the email. 'You didn't see me on the signature block, nor did you see me copied on it,' she says. 'I certainly wouldn't have directed him to Provenance and, at a minimum, certainly would not have said 'use my name when you're talking to Gordon.' That's a complete recipe for disaster.'<U+2015> <U+2015>The third woman who says she faced sexual misconduct by Sondland is Natalie Sept. In 2008, Sept moved home to Portland after a post-college job teaching in the Chicago suburbs. Sept had always been interested in politics and eventually connected with Portland City Council member Nick Fish, who was running for reelection and needed a fundraiser. He hired Sept, whose role eventually expanded to campaign manager.After Fish won his 2010 election in a landslide, Sept had breakfast with him at the restaurant of the Heathman Hotel (Provenance would add the hotel to its portfolio in 2017), a frequent watering hole for Portland's political class. Sondland, who had donated to Fish, was at a nearby table.Sept remembers that her boss introduced her to Sondland and said: ''This is Natalie. She's a rising star.'' Intrigued, Sondland invited her to another breakfast, this time at Gracie's, the cavernous dining room at the Hotel deLuxe (Provenance bought the century-old hotel in 2004).'So I'm talking to him about sports and downtown economic development, and he's telling me about the Oregon governor's film board doing a tour in LA, promising me huge opportunities, and the chance to work with the governor,' Sept recalls. In addition to being a major benefactor of the art museum, Sondland was the chair of the film board.'I was so starry-eyed about all of these institutions and people and power associated with these kinds of opportunities,' Sept says. 'I was convinced it was something he could help me attain.'Soon after, Sept learned her path crisscrossed with Sondland's in familial ways: Sondland had hired her uncle to paint his house, and her stepfather served with Sondland's wife on the Oregon Investment Council. 'I started to feel really comfortable,' Sept remembers. 'We had all these points of connection. I thought, 'I can trust this person.''Sondland invited Sept to dinner at El Gaucho, the same spot he took Vogel, to discuss a potential job at the film office. Sept showed up in a business suit, ready to network. When she arrived, she found that Sondland had ordered them what she recalls as 'the nicest bottle of wine' on the menu.Sondland spent much of the meal, Sept remembers, talking about his family and showing her pictures of his kids at the White House with then-President Bush. (The former president had appointed Sondland to the Commission on White House Fellowships.) It wasn't until the tail end of the meal that the film office job finally came up. So Sept agreed to continue the conversation down the street at Saucebox, a cocktail bar.Sept says she immediately headed for the bar's bathroom.'When I come back, he is sitting on the booth side of this big table,' she recalls. 'He says, 'Come sit next to me.' And I thought, 'Oh my god, this isn't good.' So I said, 'Oh, I forgot, I have to go home.''Sept says she apologized for cutting the evening short. Sondland paid the tab and then offered to walk her to her car. 'He keeps insisting, and I'm nervous and afraid and I don't want to make a scene, so I say, 'OK, fine,'' Sept says.At her car, Sept says, Sondland leaned in for a hug.'So I give him a quick hug and he holds onto my shoulders and looks at me and pushes himself into me and tries to kiss me.'Sept says she pushed him to the side, got into her car and sped off. The next day, trying to be the conscientious professional, she sent a follow-up email scheduling Sondland for a meeting with Fish.'What was most important was that I maintain professionalism. I didn't want him to think I was frazzled by this,' she says.In response to Sept's account, Sondland's lawyer wrote: 'Ambassador Sondland did discuss Ms. Sept's job prospects with her, but he denies any unwanted touching. He specifically denies attempting to kiss her, along with her claim that she pushed him away.'Soon after Sept's encounter, she told a friend in local government about the incident. 'She was shaken up,' says the friend, who declined to be identified. 'That sort of behavior is shocking and should be shocking, and that's how she reacted.'Sept never heard from Sondland again about the state film commission job. She went on to work for prominent Democratic politicians, including on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2016.In his statement, Sondland said he has never been aware of any accusations of unwanted touching or kissing against him. 'There has never been mention of them in any form during the period of the allegations,' he wrote, 'although such a complaint could easily have been aired through multiple channels. These false incidents are at odds with my character.'<U+2015> <U+2015>Sondland might have remained a Northwest power player, if not for his focus on becoming an ambassador, reportedly a'lifetime goal.During the 2016 presidential campaign, Sondland had pulled away from Trump, removing his name as one of the hosts of a Seattle fundraiser after Trump ridiculed the Muslim family of a slain U.S. soldier. He initially supported Jeb Bush's presidential campaign. But when Trump was elected, Sondland donated $1 million to his inaugural committee.Sondland's dream of being an envoy was realized when Trump nominated him to be ambassador to the European Union in May 2018, the latest in a line of political donors named to the position.Sondland has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in election campaign donations to mostly Republican candidates and causes. But he's also donated to various Democrats, including'Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).Wyden'spoke in support of Sondland'during his confirmation hearings. The senator said he's known 'Gordy' for more than 25 years and said he expected that Sondland would represent 'the Oregon way,' which Wyden described as 'caring about people, having a good heart.'The Senate approved Sondland's nomination by a voice vote.<U+2015> <U+2015>This fall, Vogel was driving to work, listening to NPR, when she heard 'Morning Edition' co-host Rachel Martin detailing Sondland's involvement in the impeachment inquiry.'Was there a quid pro quo?' Martin asked. 'And did Sondland make it happen?'Vogel started to cry in her car.'I'm somebody who has sort of laughed it off and rolled my eyes and said, 'What a jerk,' all these years, and suddenly I'm crying in my car?' she says. 'What the hell? That doesn't sound like me.' She recalls thinking at that moment about the transactional nature of Sondland's Ukraine mission and saw it as a painful reminder of her own experience.'The fact that [Sondland] uses his power to terrorize people who he perceives as having less power is really disgusting,' Sept says. 'I want other women to feel comfortable to share their stories, and be believed.''I would hate to see anybody else go through it. This runs so far beyond just a little groping. It affects how I do business. And who I can do business with,' says Solis. So if talking 'is the right thing to do, then that's what I'm going to do.'She wants her children to know 'what mom did what was right, that I had a sense of self and a strong character. And I want my character to be revealed to people in a positive way and in a way that is courageous to the degree that I can be.''Marty Patail and Conner Reed contributed to this report.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) acknowledged in an interview on 'CNN Newsroom' that Republicans are in public 'standing with the president for the moment,' despite the impeachment inquiry prompted by the Ukraine scandal.They 'are in a situation where they understand their base pressure, the base has not yet bolted from the president,' he explained.'But there's no question, having spoken to many of them privately, they're absolutely disgusted and exhausted by the president's behavior,' said Dent, who'stepped down from Congress in 2018. 'They resent being put in this position all the time.''Many GOP lawmakers are currently 'wrestling' with whether it was more important to win their next election or preserve their legacy for years to come, he claimed. The current consensus among political commentators is that a Republican-controlled Senate will likely not vote to convict Trump if he is impeached by the Democratic-controlled House.Earlier in the interview, Dent said he would have certainly 'voted for the impeachment inquiry based on the facts as I understand them now' and 'would probably support' the impeachment of Trump.But he cautioned Democrats against moving forward until they had secured the testimony of key witnesses in the Ukraine scandal, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former National Security Adviser John Bolton.'I think they need to close that loop and I don't think they should force this or rush this,' Dent warned.

John Kennedy (R-La.) that Ukraine, like Russia, interfered in the 2016 election <U+2015> a theory peddled by the Kremlin and rejected by U.S. intelligence agencies.'I think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election. I think it's been well documented,' Kennedy said during an appearance on NBC's 'Meet The Press.'Though Kennedy has backtracked on his comments from last week, in which he appeared to suggest Ukraine may have been behind the 2016 cyberattack against the Democratic National Committee,'he has continued to say the country interfered in the U.S. election generally.Todd pointed out that the U.S. intelligence community has said that's not true. He also noted that Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert in the National Security Council, testified before Congress last month that Ukraine did not meddle in the election.What's more, Todd said, senators were reportedly briefed by U.S. intelligence officials after Hill's testimony that Russia is behind the push to frame Ukraine for its own U.S. election interference.'This is a Russian intelligence propaganda campaign in order to get people like you to say these things about Ukraine,' he told Kennedy.

Does 17 intelligence services saying it; does every Western intelligence ally saying Russia did this? I'm just sort of confused. At what point is it no longer an opinion for you?'But Kennedy claimed it's a 'fact' that Ukraine interfered on the election, pointing to past articles in Politico and The Financial Times that reported that Ukrainian officials criticized Trump ahead of the 2016 election given his Russia-friendly comments at the time.In July 2016, Trump hinted that he supported the 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea, which is internationally recognized as a part of Ukraine. Ukrainian officials swiftly denounced his remarks.'Russia was very aggressive and they're much more sophisticated,' Kennedy said Sunday. 'But the fact that Russia was so aggressive does not exclude the fact that [former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko] actively worked for [Hillary Clinton].'An exasperated Todd interrupted Kennedy, after his claim about Poroshenko, for which there is no evidence.'You realize the only person selling this argument outside the United States is ... Vladimir Putin?' he asked. 'You've done exactly what the Russian operation is trying to get American politicians to do. Are you at all concerned that you've been duped?''No,' Kennedy said.Todd continued to grill him, asking if the senator believes there's a difference between Ukrainian officials criticizing a presidential candidate who endorsed the invasion of their country ' as Trump had ' compared to Russia hacking the DNC servers.'Let's suppose <U+2015> and I don't believe <U+2015> but you're right and I'm wrong,' Kennedy said. 'Then what harm would it do to allow the president of the United States, who has a demonstrated record of fighting foreign corruption, to introduce evidence?'Todd noted that Trump has been given 'every opportunity to provide exculpatory evidence' on the matter and hasn't done so.Kennedy then claimed the ongoing impeachment inquiry into Trump, which is centered on the president's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, is''as rigged as carnival ring toss.'He also claimed Trump hasn't been able to call his own witnesses or have legal representation during the hearings.However, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) asked Republicans last week which witnesses they would like to have testify on behalf of Trump.

For those who don't know me from my previous stint, I'm the audience development manager for HuffPost Canada, and this week, I'm excited to tell you about a story that caught my eye from HuffPost India.First, I want you to picture a superhero in your mind. Is it a man or a woman? Are they wearing tights? And are they fighting for some kind of general sense of justice?For'India's first female superhero, justice is a bit more defined. Priya, who first debuted in 'Priya's Shakti' in 2014, is a sexual assault survivor who uses her powers to fight violence against women. In the next volume, 2016's 'Priya's Mirror,' she works with acid attack survivors to spread a message of body positivity.Now in 2019, she's taking on sex trafficking in 'Priya and the Lost Girls.' Binjal Shah, a writer for HuffPost India, finds the subject matter both innovative and incredibly important at this moment in time.'In a country where religious fundamentalism is on the rise and society is seen shifting back to conservative values, a female superhero ' dark-skinned and salwar-kameez clad, no less ' with a compelling origin story involving surviving rape and resisting the stigma that comes with ' was path-breaking at several levels,' Binjal says.And while the target audience for these stories ' that is, the teens of Gen-Z ' might seem young, Binjal is quick to point out that they're hardly unfamiliar with the concepts.'The younger population is much better poised to join conversations about all the ways in which we can change the world than even millennials were at that age. They're at the forefront of protests, online campaigns and in general, are leading by example by being more socially conscious. Popular culture ought to keep up with that and feed that further ' and superheroes like Priya are going to lead the charge,' she says.It seems that fans in India agree, as creator Ram Devineni tells HuffPost that 'Priya and the Lost Girls' has received a ton of positive press coverage and downloads are streaming in already.While it might seem heavy, the idea of a superhero who survived rape only to go on and help others through a variety of powers feels like exactly the kind of lesson kids (not to mention their grown-ups) could learn from.It did make me wonder about other 'alternative' superheroes who might be out there.

After all, a minor 'tweak' doesn't sound like a big deal, but experts say the positive benefits don't last long.Throughout his presidency, Donald Trump has routinely degraded and attacked women and immigrants. Over the course of the impeachment hearings, some of the most incriminating testimony has come from those very people, like Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Laura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary at the Defense Department, and White House adviser Fiona Hill, who has the distinction of being both an immigrant and a woman.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"302",1458659661,"Republicans Are Trying To Use Impeachment To Win 2020 Congressional Races","WASHINGTON (AP) ' Republicans aim to use the House drive toward impeaching President Donald Trump to whittle down Democrats' majority by dislodging vulnerable incumbents from swing districts loaded with moderate voters.It could work, especially in Democratic-held districts Trump carried in 2016 with throngs of independent voters who polls shows are closely divided over his removal. Or it could flop, in an era when news zooms by so swiftly that today's concerns may be eclipsed in 11 months and many people are more focused on pocketbook issues such as health care costs.'It will be part of the mosaic, but hardly the overriding issue,' GOP pollster Whit Ayres predicted about impeachment's impact next November. 'It will have faded by then and it will also have simply reinforced the preexisting attitudes and made them more intense.'What's clear is that for now, Republicans are wielding impeachment mostly as an offensive weapon and Democrats are generally playing defense or changing the subject as 2020 congressional races rev up. House Democrats will be defending their 233-197 majority, with four vacancies. Republicans will try preserving their 53-47 Senate control.Since late September, Republicans and their allies have spent $8 million on impeachment-related TV ads aimed at House members, according to Advertising Analytics, a nonpartisan firm that examines political spending. That's triple the sum spent by Democrats and their supporters.The American Action Network, closely aligned with House GOP leaders, has produced TV and digital ads attacking 30 Democrats, mostly freshmen. Spots also 'thank' seven Republicans for opposing impeachment, a tactic often used to pressure lawmakers to stand firm.In one, the announcer accuses Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., of abandoning health care and other issues to back impeachment and says, 'Tell Congressman Cunningham, 'Let the voters decide elections.'' The announcer speaks amid images of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who's led the impeachment inquiry.GOP groups regularly blast impeachment-themed fundraising emails. Relatively obscure Republicans such as Rep. Elise Stefanik of upstate New York have reaped campaign contribution bonanzas by taking high-profile roles defending Trump.'This process they're embarking on is going to cost them their majority next fall,' said Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., who heads his party's House campaign committee. He said Democrats have 'an obsession' with impeachment, adding, 'It's just getting worse for them.'While Democrats are favored to retain House control, the early blitz of GOP attacks has prompted them to protect their targeted members.House Majority Forward, an outside group tied to top House Democrats, has spent nearly $2 million defending 14 Democratic incumbents. All but three are freshmen from Trump-won districts.'Forget the noise. Haley Stevens is focused on Michigan,' said an ad citing the first-term Michigan Democrat.Pro-impeachment groups have run ads attacking GOP lawmakers for supporting Trump. That included liberal groups MoveOn and Need to Impeach, which put billboard trucks in eight House Republicans' districts from Nevada to New York that carried signs saying, 'Defend democracy. Impeach Trump.'Stefanik's step into the spotlight has had decidedly mixed results. Her little-known Democratic opponent, Tedra Cobb, announced she had raised more than $1 million soon after Stefanik stepped into the impeachment spotlight. Cobb has been bolstered by celebrities such as ``Star Wars'' actor Mark Hamill, who urged his 3.4 million Twitter followers to back Cobb and help Stefanik 'spend more time being a #TrumpToady on Fox 'News.''Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., who leads House Democrats' campaign committee, said Emmer is 'precisely wrong' about her party.'When we are not out in Washington, we are home, in our districts and we are listening to people every day, and we are hyper-focused on local issues,' she said.After an initial uptick in support for ousting Trump over his efforts to pressure Ukraine to seek dirt on his Democratic political rivals, voters' views have jelled.About 9 in 10 Democrats support removing Trump and similar shares of Republicans back him, while independents are roughly evenly divided. Trump seems certain to be impeached, or found worthy of removal, by the Democratic-led House but likely acquitted by the GOP-majority Senate and kept in office.Last fall's elections left Democrats in control of 31 seats in districts Trump carried in 2016. GOP lawmakers hold just three seats in districts Democrat Hillary Clinton won. Democrats also outnumber Republicans 62-30 among freshmen, who are often more vulnerable targets.Many competitive Democratic seats are in suburbs, where centrist voters have abandoned the GOP in recent elections over Trump's coarse behavior and conservative policies. Republicans will have to guard against impeachment accelerating those defections, while Democrats must watch for signs suburban voters think they're overreacting.For moderate Democrats, 'the smart response is to keep doing their job, be in the district, meet with constituents, listen to what they're saying,' said centrist Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., a leader of Democrats' efforts to defend endangered incumbents.Democratic pollster John Anzalone said his party's candidates should focus on issues that helped clinch their 2018 House takeover.'I will take any day being able talk about health care and education and the environment and wages if they're talking about impeachment,' Anzalone said.The reverse dynamic is true in the Senate, where perhaps two Democrats and five Republicans face competitive reelections. Those in the trickiest spots on impeachment include Democratic Sen. Doug Jones of staunchly pro-Trump Alabama and GOP Sen. Cory Gardner in Democratic-leaning Colorado.GOP pollster Glen Bolger said while it was unpredictable how powerful a factor impeachment will be in 2020, swing state Republican senators have little choice from a purely political standpoint.'You can't vote for removal,' Bolger said. 'You'll have just totally collapsed your base, your ability to raise money, to get volunteers.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here's how.",2019-11-30 13:53:58

'The only reason for them to go through this is to mollify the president, and that's not a good reason to call a member of Congress.'Schiff hasn't commented on whether he would refuse to testify if called to do so, but said Republicans would show a 'fundamental lack of seriousness' if they subpoenaed him.Asked Sunday if he sees anything wrong with Trump asking Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden, a request that is the focus of the ongoing impeachment inquiry, Collins defended the president.'I think it's interesting that the premise of your question is based on witnesses who agree with your premise,' Collins said, apparently referring to the multiple current and former State Department officials who testified that the White House used military aid as leverage in an effort to get Ukraine to commit to investigating Biden.<U+2033>President Trump has always been concerned about foreign aid,' he added.

"305",1458659357,"Trump Faces Two Deadlines As U.S. Congress Ramps Up Impeachment Focus","WASHINGTON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump faced two deadlines in Congress this week as Democrats prepared to shift the focus of their impeachment inquiry from fact-finding to the consideration of possible charges of misconduct over his dealings with Ukraine.The Democratic-led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, tasked with considering charges known as articles of impeachment, has given Trump until 6 p.m. (2300 GMT) on Sunday to say whether he or his legal counsel will participate in an impeachment hearing on Wednesday.The first-in-a-series of expected Judiciary proceedings will hear testimony on the impeachment process established under the U.S. Constitution from a panel of legal experts that has yet to be named.Hearings before the committee, which has responsibility for crafting any formal charges against Trump, are a major step toward possible charges. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who will make the final decision, has not yet said whether the Republican president should be impeached. But in a letter to supporters last week, she called for him to be held accountable for his actions.Trump has denied any wrongdoing, calling the impeachment inquiry a 'witch hunt.' The White House has not yet indicated whether it will take part in the committee proceedings.Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler also set a 5 p.m. (2200 GMT) Friday deadline for Trump to say whether he will mount a defense at further proceedings expected next week to examine evidence against him.Three investigating panels, led by the House Intelligence Committee, are due to release a formal report this week when lawmakers return on Tuesday from a Thanksgiving recess. The report will outline evidence gathered by the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees.Members of the intelligence panel will review the report in a classified setting on Monday evening, and the full committee will consider and vote on it on Tuesday before forwarding it to the Judiciary Committee, according to an Intelligence Committee official and a person familiar with the matter.Congressional investigators have been looking into whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to launch investigations of former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden, who is running to unseat him in the 2020 presidential election, and a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Representative Doug Collins, the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said in an interview with 'Fox News Sunday' that the White House would mount a defense during upcoming impeachment proceedings and suggested calling Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee, as a witness.In a separate interview on ABC's 'This Week,' another Judiciary Committee Republican, Representative Tom McClintock, suggested the possibility that Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, should testify.Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a member of the House Democratic leadership and the Judiciary Committee, told 'Fox News Sunday:' 'We all may want to hear from John Bolton. We all would like to hear from Mick Mulvaney.'In September, Trump fired Bolton as national security adviser, citing policy disagreements.The president and his Republican allies in Congress say the inquiry has been rushed and unfair to Trump by not allowing the White House to have legal counsel present or call witnesses during weeks of closed-door testimony and open hearings beforethe House Intelligence Committee.Republican lawmakers were able to question witnesses duringthe closed hearings, however, and called three witnesses duringpublic hearings that wrapped up last week.'The president may well look at this, or his counsel maywell look at this, and say: Why would we want to get in here and legitimize this process when it was made illegitimate at the beginning by shutting us out?' said Republican Representative Tom Cole.The House Judiciary Committee could vote on whether to recommend articles of impeachment within the next two weeks, setting the stage of a possible impeachment vote by the full House before Christmas, according to Democratic aides.If the House impeaches Trump, the Republican-controlled Senate would hold a trial to determine whether he should be removed from office. Senate Republicans have shown little appetite for removing Trump.(Reporting by David Morgan, Richard Cowan and Andrea Shalal; Additional reporting by Patricia Zengerle, Jonathan Landay and Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Peter Cooney)Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

His Republican allies have stoutly defended him.Politico notes the White House's refusal to take part this week may indicate Trump has listened to allies who worried any participation could validate the impeachment process that they have sought to undermine. The president's allies in Congress who sit on the Judiciary Committee will likely use this week's hearings to further defend Trump.Read the full letter below.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"310",1459421123,"House Intel Will Release Impeachment Report Ahead Of Landmark Hearing","WASHINGTON (AP) ' The House impeachment report on President Donald Trump will be unveiled Monday behind closed doors for key lawmakers as Democrats push ahead with the inquiry despite the White House's declaration it will not participate in the first Judiciary Committee hearing.The Democratic majority on the House Intelligence Committee says the report, compiled after'weeks of testimony,'will speak for itself in laying out what Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., called the evidence of 'wrongdoing and misconduct' by the Republican president over his actions toward Ukraine. It was being made available for committee members to review ahead of a vote Tuesday to send it to the Judiciary Committee for Wednesday's landmark hearing.Late Sunday, White House counsel Pat Cipollone denounced the 'baseless and highly partisan inquiry.' In a letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., he also declined the invitation for the president's counsel to appear before his panel Wednesday.Cipollone, in continuing the West Wing's attack on the House process, said the proceeding 'violates all past historical precedent, basic due process rights, and fundamental fairness.' Trump himself was scheduled to attend a summit with NATO allies outside London on Wednesday.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday it's 'very unfortunate' the Judiciary Committee is holding its hearing at the same time that Trump is representing the U.S. at the NATO summit.'I regret that they've chosen to hold these hearings at the same time that the president and our entire national security team will be traveling to Europe, to London, to work on these important matters,' Pompeo said.As'the impeachment inquiry'intensifies, Wednesday's hearing will be a milestone. It is expected to convene legal experts whose testimony, alongside the report from the Intelligence Committee, could lay the groundwork for possible articles of impeachment, which the panel is expected to soon draw up.Democrats are focused on whether Trump abused his office by'withholding military aid'approved by Congress and a White House meeting as he'pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy'to launch investigations into Trump's political rivals. The report also is expected to include evidence of possible obstruction of Congress by Trump's instructions that officials in his administration defy subpoenas for documents or testimony.Trump maintains he did nothing wrong, and as the House presses forward on an ambitious schedule toward an impeachment vote, the president and his Republican allies are aligned against the process.Cipollone's letter applied only to the Wednesday hearing, and he demanded more information from Democrats on how they intended to conduct further hearings before Trump would decide whether to participate in them. House rules provide the president and his attorneys the right to cross-examine witnesses and review evidence before the committee, but little ability to bring forward witnesses of their own.Republicans, meanwhile, wanted Schiff, the chairman who led the inquiry report, to testify before the Judiciary Committee, though they have no power to compel him to do so, as they joined the White House effort to try to cast the Democratic-led inquiry as skewed against the Republican president.'It's easy to hide behind a report,' said Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee. 'But it's going to be another thing to actually get up and have to answer questions.'Schiff has said 'there's nothing for me to testify about,' that he isn't a 'fact' witness and that Republicans are only trying to 'mollify the president, and that's not a good reason to try to call a member of Congress as a witness.'Democrats were aiming for a final House vote by Christmas, which would set the stage for a likely Senate trial in January.'I do believe that all evidence certainly will be included in that report so the Judiciary Committee can make the necessary decisions that they need to,' said Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., a member of both the Intelligence and Judiciary committees.Trump has previously suggested that he might be willing to offer written testimony under certain conditions, though aides suggested they did not anticipate Democrats would ever agree to them.Democrats had pressed Trump to decide by Friday whether he would take advantage of due process protections afforded to him under House rules adopted in October for follow-up hearings, including the right to request witness testimony and to cross-examine the witnesses called by the House.'If you are serious about conducting a fair process going forward, and in order to protect the rights and privileges of the President, we may consider participating in future Judiciary Committee proceedings if you afford the Administration the ability to do so meaningfully,' Cipollone said in the Sunday letter.Collins called the hearing Wednesday 'a complete American waste of time of here.' He wanted the witness list expanded to include those suggested by Republicans. 'This is why this is a problematic exercise and simply a made-for-TV event coming on Wednesday.'Still, Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., a Judiciary Committee member, said he believes Trump would benefit if he presents his own defense. McClintock said he doesn't believe Trump did anything wrong in the July 25 call with Zelenskiy that is at the heart of the investigation.'He didn't use the delicate language of diplomacy in that conversation, that's true. He also doesn't use the smarmy talk of politicians,' McClintock said.To McClintock, Trump was using 'the blunt talk of a Manhattan businessman' and 'was entirely within his constitutional authority' in his dealings with Ukraine's leader.Collins appeared on 'Fox News Sunday' and Demings and McClintock were on ABC's 'This Week.'___Associated Press writers Zeke Miller and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

'I think that's just about fairness. It's not about a quid pro quo.'Trump's intention to exchange military aid earmarked for Ukraine'for dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden is at the heart of the House's impeachment inquiry, along with efforts by Trump and White House officials to spread a conspiracy theory about Ukraine <U+2015> not Russia <U+2015> interfering in the 2016 election.The conspiracy theory about election meddling by Ukraine has been dispelled by the U.S. Intelligence Community and, more recently, during congressional testimony by the Trump administration's former top Russia expert, Dr. Fiona Hill. But Trump's allies in Congress and conservative media have continued to spread the discredited theory. On Sunday, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) befuddled 'Meet the Press' host Chuck Todd when he regurgitated anti-Ukrainian talking points widely acknowledged as pro-Russian misinformation.In the Time interview, Zelensky told reporters how these conspiracy theories harm Ukraine:The United States of America is a signal, for the world, for everyone. When America says, for instance, that Ukraine is a corrupt country, that is the hardest of signals. It might seem like an easy thing to say, that combination of words: Ukraine is a corrupt country. Just to say it and that's it. But it doesn't end there. Everyone hears that signal. Investments, banks, stakeholders, companies, American, European, companies that have international capital in Ukraine, it's a signal to them that says, 'Be careful, don't invest.' Or, 'Get out of there.' This is a hard signal.Trump has repeatedly said his efforts to extort Ukraine were meant to root out government misconduct in the country, which ousted its former leader, President Petro Poroshenko, for corruption. Billing himself as a reformer, Zelensky succeeded Poroshenko on an anti-corruption platform, and he told Time he has nothing to prove to Trump.'I don't need to change his mind,' Zelensky said. 'During my meeting with him, I said that I don't want our country to have this image. For that, all he has to do is come and have a look at what's happening, how we live, what kinds of people we are.'Zelensky also discussed Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia's encroachment into Ukrainian territory and what he described as a decline in global support for Ukrainian independence.'Asked whether he trusts Putin to conduct peace talks with Ukraine in good faith, Zelensky said: 'I don't trust anyone at all.' He added: 'I don't know these people. I can't understand what dough they're made of. That's why I think nobody can have any trust.

Lawyers tell me @SteveHiltonx is a wild card and I should sue him for libel. He recklessly disregarded the truth!Giuliani went on to state that Hilton 'should apologize for his maliciousness and thank me' for putting former Vice President Joe Biden's family in the headlines, which the lawyer did by raising unsubstantiated corruption allegations against the 2020 White House hopeful and his son Hunter Biden.A Fox News representative did not respond to HuffPost's request for comment.Giuliani has been central to Trump's attacks on Joe Biden by attempting to raise suspicions about Hunter Biden's past work on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy firm that was the target of a corruption probe by former prosecutor general Viktor Shokin. During his vice presidency, Biden had advocated alongside the international community for Shokin's ouster <U+2015> something Trump and his allies have tried to paint as a scandal. However, there is no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Bidens, and the Burisma investigation was dormant'by the time Biden pushed for Shokin's firing.In July, Trump requested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky assist Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr with a probe of the Bidens. The request raised concerns as a possible solicitation of foreign election interference and is at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry.Last month, The New York Times and The Washington Post reported that Giuliani was privately pursuing business contacts in Ukraine while simultaneously searching for dirt on Biden. However, he has claimed that no deals were finalized and that he was paid nothing.Hilton's recent advice to Trump may not have fallen on deaf ears.

"315",1459685017,"Trump’s Latest Impeachment Legal Strategy: Ignore It Entirely","WASHINGTON <U+2015> As the House gears up to consider formal articles of impeachment, President Donald Trump appears to have shifted to a new strategy: pretending it's not even happening.'The whole thing is a hoax,' Trump said Monday in answer to a question about why he would not be sending a representative to the House Judiciary Committee's first impeachment hearing on Wednesday. The president was leaving for a NATO meeting in London this week.The previous night, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone had written a letter to the Judiciary Committee's chairman, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), to inform him of the decision.Cipollone said the House Intelligence Committee's refusal to let Trump's lawyers present and cross-examine witnesses during its hearings last month had created 'profound procedural deficiencies that have tainted this entire inquiry.'Trump's critics said the new approach is basically a continuation of the old approach <U+2015> which was to argue about an unfair 'process' because the actual facts of the case are truly bad for the president.'The only thing that Trump is entitled to is for the House to approve a statement of the charges against him by a majority vote,' said George Conway, husband of a top Trump aide and a lawyer who worked with Republicans in the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. 'How the House goes about deciding to do that <U+2015> whether it decides to hear live fact witnesses, as it did here, or to rely essentially on hearsay documents, as it did with the Starr report when it impeached Clinton in 1998 <U+2015> is entirely up to the House.'Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, after initially investigating Clinton's real estate deals in Arkansas, ultimately reported that in a sexual harassment lawsuit Clinton had lied under oath about an unrelated intimate relationship with a White House intern. House Republicans impeached him for perjury and obstruction of justice.While Trump and his supporters have frequently complained that he hasn't even been given the 'due process' rights of an accused criminal, in reality the opposite is true.A mobster, for example, would not be able to prevent his top underlings from appearing before a grand jury, where prosecutors can compel testimony. In contrast, Trump has been able to stop senior officials with direct knowledge of the Ukraine situation from appearing before the House impeachment proceedings, including acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and even Vice President Mike Pence.'A mafia don who ordered non-compliance with grand jury proceedings would be charged with witness tampering and obstruction of justice,' said Danya Perry, a former federal prosecutor in New York City.Not cooperating with the probe has been the through-line of Trump's response from the very beginning.In early September, as House leaders learned that an intelligence community whistleblower had filed a complaint about a Trump phone call with a foreign leader, the White House at first sought to prevent the complaint from being turned over to the House Intelligence Committee despite a law that requires it, arguing that the complaint was invalid because the president is not part of the intelligence community.A few weeks later, the White House essentially took the position that the House had no right to conduct an impeachment inquiry and sent Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) a letter saying it would not permit executive branch officials to testify or turn over documents.As it turned out, current and former administration officials from the State Department and the National Security Council ignored that directive and testified anyway, providing damning evidence backing up the whistleblower's complaint. The White House itself released a rough transcript of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump responds with 'I would like you to do us a favor though' immediately after Zelensky mentions military assistance.According to witness testimony as well as the phone call memo, Trump demanded that Ukraine investigate the Democrat he most feared as a 2020 opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden. He also wanted support for a conspiracy theory that falsely claims that Russian intelligence agencies did not help Trump win the 2016 election, but rather Ukrainian officials framed Russia using fake evidence. Trump made the congressionally approved security aid contingent on Ukraine publicly announcing the two probes, but then backed down after the White House learned that the whistleblower's complaint was about to reach Congress.The $391 million in military assistance to Ukraine, which is under continuing attack by Russia, was released on Sept. 11 ' two days after the House announced it was opening an investigation into the matter.'The American people deserve transparency,' Nadler said on Monday. 'If the president thinks the call was 'perfect' and there is nothing to hide, then he would turn over the thousands of pages of documents requested by Congress, allow witnesses to testify instead of blocking testimony with baseless privilege claims, and provide any exculpatory information that refutes the overwhelming evidence of his abuse of power.'In his Sunday night letter, Cipollone said the White House was reserving its right to participate in subsequent hearings held by Nadler.Conway, who supported Trump during the 2016 general election but decided not long afterward that he was not fit for the Oval Office, said the White House's refusal to take part now shows that Trump was never really interested in putting up a legitimate defense.'The House gave Trump rights it didn't have to give him, and yet he didn't avail himself of them,' Conway said. 'Which makes clear not only that he has no substantive defense but that his procedural complaints are a sham, a political ruse to fool low-information voters.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

But the lawmakers said the evidence thus far shows there was 'nothing wrong' with Trump's decision to withhold the aid to Ukraine, claiming that the president held a 'deep-seated, genuine, and reasonable skepticism' of the country that made his actions 'entirely prudent.''The Democrats nonetheless tell a story of an illicit pressure campaign run by President Trump through his personal attorney, Mayor Giuliani, to coerce Ukraine to investigate the President's political rival by withholding a meeting and security assistance,' the document reads. 'There is, however, no direct, firsthand evidence of any such scheme.'Trump's conduct in office has been described in detail by a parade of current and former administration officials. During public and private hearings, the officials testified that the president waged an explicit campaign to pressure a foreign leader to investigate a political rival.But the ranking Republican members of the House committees conducting the inquiry remain defiant in the face of those accounts, saying the 'evidence presented does not prove any of these Democrat allegations, and none of the Democrats' witnesses testified to having evidence of bribery, extortion, or any high crime or misdemeanor.''Democrats in the House of Representatives have been working to impeach President Trump since his election,' reads the report, prepared for Republican Reps. Devin Nunes (Calif.), ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee; Jim Jordan (Ohio), ranking member of the House Oversight Committee; and Michael McCaul (Texas), ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Top Democrats are investigating whether the president acted improperly during that call when he requested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Biden's son Hunter shortly after holding up nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine.The White House said Sunday it would not take part in the committee's first hearing, claiming the probe 'does not begin to provide the president with any semblance of a fair process' and slamming the proceedings as 'highly partisan.''We cannot fairly be expected to participate in a hearing while the witnesses are yet to be named and while it remains unclear whether the Judiciary Committee will afford the president a fair process through additional hearings,' White House Counsel Pat Cipollone wrote in a five-page letter to House Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.).

Richard Burr (R-N.C.) on Monday refused to say whether he's seen evidence that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election, declining to directly rebut a debunked conspiracy theory floated by some of his fellow GOP lawmakers and President Donald Trump.Burr, the chairman of the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee, instead played a game of words with reporters on Capitol Hill who pressed him about an interview with Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who suggested the Ukranian government worked 'actively' to help elect Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton. Trump later thanked Kennedy 'for the job he did in representing both the Republican Party and myself' on Twitter.'Every elected official in the Ukraine was for Hillary Clinton,' Burr claimed Monday, according to NBC's Frank Thorp. 'Is that very different than the Russians being for Donald Trump?'Asked if he had seen any evidence to back up the claim that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election, Burr answered by addressing a different question, saying he didn't think 'there's any question that elected officials in Ukraine had a favorite in the election.'Russia didn't simply prefer Trump in 2016. The U.S. intelligence community has stated definitively that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee's servers and leaked thousands of emails in an effort to discredit Democrats and help Trump win the presidency in 2016. Trump has claimed, without evidence, that Ukraine was behind the cyberattack, however.Burr's own committee concluded that Russia used social media campaigns to sow discord among the American electorate in 2016, adding that the activity was 'overtly and almost invariably supportive of then-candidate Trump.'The committee also looked into the theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election but 'found no evidence that Ukraine waged a top-down interference campaign akin to the Kremlin's efforts to help Trump win in 2016,' according to Politico.But Burr did not mention those conclusions on Monday and continued to insist in an extended Q&A that a 'preference' for a candidate is somehow on the same footing as a foreign government waging a systematic campaign to affect an election's outcome:Here's the end of our Q+A with Senate Intel Cmte Chair @SenatorBurr: pic.twitter.com/VGztwulirCIn her testimony at a House impeachment hearing last month,'former National Security Council member Fiona Hill, a top Russia expert, warned that Republicans were playing into Russian President Vladimir Putin's hands by pointing the finger at Ukraine.'Based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country <U+2015> and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,' Hill said at the hearing.''This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.'Nevertheless, Trump and his Republican allies on Capitol Hill have continued to seek to shift the narrative that Russia meddled in the 2016 election.Democrats on Monday slammed their GOP counterparts for' 'disgracefully' repeating Russian propaganda.'The charge that Ukraine had something to do with election meddling in 2016 is a lie spread by Vladimir Putin to get things off his back,' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a floor speech.Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) added in an interview on MSNBC: 'My hope has been all along that the Senate would be able to survive the Trump presidency, that we wouldn't be pulled down into this cesspool of lies and mistruths.

Trump has declared that the 'whole thing is a hoax.''The idea that a president on his own can unilaterally say, 'Oh,'I'm not going to bother cooperating with an impeachment investigation'? That is the essence of constitutional arrogance and the destruction of our separation of powers. I think it is an impeachable offense just the way the president has acted toward this impeachment investigation.''Katyal, a Georgetown law professor, said impeachment was specifically written into the Constitution because of fears about a president 'who's beholden to a foreign power' or one who 'tries to interfere with his re-election.' Both appear to apply to Trump, he indicated.He said the House has already demonstrated the president engaged in bribery, which is specifically named in the Constitution as an impeachable offense. 'The president was saying' to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky: 'Look,'I'll give you this goodie, this aid that the taxpayers have appropriated and I'm holding up, but in exchange, you've got to do something for me first' ' namely, launch an investigation of Trump's political rival Joe Biden. In effect, said Katyal, Trump was 'trying to cheat in the 2020 election; he was trying to get a leg up on his political rival.'Not only is Trump refusing to participate, but he has also 'tried to gag every executive branch employee' and blocked 'every document, every phone call, everything from being given to Congress,' Katyal said.'I can't think of something that is more destructive to our Constitution,' he warned.'Check out what else Katyal has to say in the video above.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

By doing so, it formally passed the impeachment proceedings to the House Judiciary Committee, which will begin its own set of impeachment hearings Wednesday.The report comes after several marathon days of hearings in November, featuring testimony from current and former U.S. officials familiar with the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the events surrounding it, which are at the center of the inquiry.During the call, Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, whose son had business dealings in the country while Biden was vice president. The president also pushed the roundly debunked claim that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 presidential election.'The Intelligence Committee report states that 'the call record alone is stark evidence of misconduct; a demonstration of the President's prioritization of his personal political benefit over the national interest.' But it also details other allegations of improper conduct by the president,'his administration and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani'to influence Ukraine, calling it 'a dramatic crescendo within a months-long campaign ... to extract from a foreign nation the personal political benefits sought by the President.''Among the new revelations were phone records showing that House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who repeatedly decried the investigation, was repeatedly in contact with people allegedly involved in the scheme, including Giuliani and his associate Lev Parnas. Parnas'was'arrested in October for allegedly funneling foreign money to support Trump and Republican candidates.'Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said during a press conference that it was 'deeply concerning' that members of Congress may have been 'complicit.''(Nunes' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the phone records in the report.)'Intelligence Committee Democrats write in the report that they're not out to 'overturn an election,' as Republicans have claimed for weeks. Instead, they write that the authors of the U.S. Constitution gave Congress impeachment powers specifically 'as a remedy of last resort for a president who fails to faithfully execute his oath of office 'to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.''The report also details efforts by Trump to thwart Congress' investigation, calling it 'an unprecedented campaign of obstruction by the President and his Administration to prevent the Committees from obtaining documentary evidence and testimony.' A dozen witnesses refused to testify, including some who were subpoenaed, and multiple agencies and the White House itself declined to turn over relevant documents.Trump also sought to intimidate witnesses who did agree to come forward, the report alleges, noting that it is 'a federal crime to intimidate or seek to intimidate any witness appearing before Congress.' The president did so by publicly attacking multiple witnesses as well as an anonymous whistleblower who expressed concerns about his call with Zelensky.'If left unanswered, President Trump's ongoing effort to thwart Congress' impeachment power risks doing grave harm to the institution of Congress, the balance of power between our branches of government, and the Constitutional order that the President and every Member of Congress have sworn to protect and defend,' the report states.Trump has insisted he did nothing wrong; he has said repeatedly that his call with Zelensky was 'perfect.' Soon after the Democrats released their report, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham dismissed it as part of 'a one-sided sham process' and claimed lawmakers 'utterly failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump.''Chairman Schiff's report reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger straining to prove something when there is evidence of nothing,' Grisham said in a statement.Giuliani has similarly denied any wrongdoing, including after Democrats released their report, which included phone records showing his conversations with the Office of Management and Budget <U+2015> the agency involved in delaying aid for Ukraine.'I did not have any knowledge of aid that's it,' he said in a text message to HuffPost. 'None. Zero and no one has claimed I did. Otherwise I don't comment on discussions with WH.'Trump's Republican allies on Capitol Hill have largely agreed with his claims that the inquiry is unfair. And Republicans have said the slew of witnesses testifying about what happened between the U.S. and Ukraine are simply mistaken about Trump's motives. Trump wasn't out for dirt on his political rival, Republicans argued in their own report this week. Rather, the president withheld assistance from Ukraine because of his 'long-standing, deep-seated skepticism of Ukraine due to its history of pervasive corruption.'Republican lawmakers have struggled to point to other examples of Trump attacking corruption, despite his 'drain the swamp' campaign slogan.'As Democrats note in their report, according to the White House memorandum of the call with Zelenesky, 'President Trump did not mention corruption at all.'Read the report below:   20191203 - Full Report Hpsci Impeachment Inquiry - 20191203 by Mollie Reilly on ScribdThis article has been updated with more details from the report.

"325",1460655062,"Republicans To Go It Alone In Impeachment Trial If Senate Can’t Agree On Rules","Republicans will seek to craft rules governing a potential impeachment trial of President Donald Trump on their own if they can't reach an agreement on guidelines with Democrats, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday.The Kentucky Republican has already declared that the GOP-controlled Senate would follow through with a trial should the House impeach Trump. He has also suggested that the Senate would not cut short such a trial, allowing evidence against Trump to be presented.What remains far less clear, however, is how such a trial would be conducted <U+2015> which witnesses, if any, will be called to testify, which senators will be allowed to speak and for how long, and how much power Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who would preside over the proceedings, will wield.'There is no answer at this point' to such questions, McConnell told reporters at his weekly press conference at the Capitol.Should he fail to reach an agreement with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) at the outset of a trial, McConnell said he 'would probably come back to my own members and say, OK, can 51 of my own members agree how we're going to handle this.' If that fails, McConnell described a hypothetical 'jump ball' scenario in which the Senate would vote on witnesses on a case-by-case basis.During the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, the Republican-controlled Senate reached a bipartisan agreement governing some of the proceedings. It failed, however, to reach a deal on witness testimony. That decision was put to the entire Senate in a series of votes. In one of those votes, the upper chamber voted 70-30 not to call Monica Lewinsky as a live witness because many feared the 'salacious details' involved in the case would tarnish the Senate.In advance of a Trump impeachment trial, some Republican lawmakers and other allies of the president have expressed a desire to see former Vice President Joe Biden and perhaps his son Hunter Biden testify. They argue that the two would be key witnesses in the case, given that Democrats pushing for impeachment argue that Trump abused his power by allegedly withholding congressionally approved aid to Ukraine in exchange for that country's leaders announcing an investigation into the Bidens' Ukrainian business dealings.Other possible witnesses floated by some Republicans include the U.S. intelligence community whistleblower whose concerns that Trump pushed for such a quid pro quo in phone call with Ukraine's president kicked the impeachment push into high gear. Another of the potential witnesses wanted by the Trump allies is House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who chaired the impeachment hearings in the lower chamber and helped author his panel's report citing 'overwhelming' evidence of misconduct by Trump in the Ukraine matter.'If the White House chooses to call witnesses in its defense, and obvious potential witnesses include Hunter Biden or the whistleblower, I believe the Senate should allow the White House to present its witnesses,' Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said Tuesday.Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said Schiff would be 'one of my favorites' on a list of possible impeachment witnesses.'But McConnell acknowledged Tuesday that it's possible Republicans would encounter difficulty in getting the 51 votes needed to call some of those witnesses. Joe Biden, for example, is a former senator with decades of relationships with several of the chamber's members. He also happens to be running for president in 2020. Insisting he or his son testify could sow further discord in the upper chamber and alienate a small group of moderates and frequent Trump critics who have expressed distaste with his conduct regarding Ukraine.'I don't think that is likely appropriate, but I want to see all of the evidence before making any decisions in that way,' Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told a reporter last week when asked if either Biden should testify in an impeachment trial.Republicans have a slim hold on the upper chamber, 53-47, meaning they'd need nearly all their members to sign off on either a rules package or individual witness testimony.Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said the trial 'can't just be a dog and pony show,' adding that it's 'got to be serious proceedings.' When asked if he wants Hunter Biden to testify, however, Manchin declined to rule out supporting such a motion, saying, 'Anything that is relevant to this trial should be heard.'Schumer said Tuesday he had not yet begun discussions with McConnell about an impeachment trial. But he added that he hoped the Senate could avoid a partisan proceeding, which appears on track to take place sometime next month.'The best way to do something as important and almost a hallowed procedure as this is in a bipartisan fashion,' Schumer said.CORRECTION: During Clinton's impeachment trial, the Senate was controlled by the Republicans <U+2015> not the Democrats, as a previous version of the story mistakenly said.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), was privately in contact with key players in President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine that led to the impeachment inquiry.The report, which came after several long days of hearings last month, contains phone logs from AT&T that show Nunes had multiple calls in April with Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Giuliani's now-indicted business associate Lev Parnas. John Solomon, then a right-wing contributor with The Hill'who helped push Ukrainian conspiracy theories, also had calls with Parnas and Giuliani at the same time Nunes was in contact with them.While most of the information in the report was already known thanks to public witness hearings and increased transparency over obtained documents, the call records involving Nunes are new. All three of those players Nunes was involved with had an important role in Trump's attempt to pressure Ukraine's government to investigate his 2020 political rival former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden and a widely debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.'The contacts occurred after Solomon published a column on April 7 that smeared Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Yovanovitch was abruptly removed from her position in May after Trump allies and conservative media <U+2015> specifically Solomon <U+2015> falsely accused her of conspiring with Democrats to influence the 2016 presidential election and release damaging information against Trump. Most of Solomon's sourcing came from Yuriy Lutsenko, a former Ukrainian top prosecutor who originated the lies about Yovanovitch after clashing with her about corruption in his own office.'Over the course of the four days following the April 7 article, phone records show contacts between Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas, Representative Devin Nunes, and Mr. Solomon. Specifically, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Parnas were in contact with one another, as well as with Mr. Solomon,' the report stated. 'Phone records also show contacts on April 10 between Mr. Giuliani and Rep. Nunes, consisting of three short calls in rapid succession, followed by a text message, and ending with a nearly three minute call. Later that same day, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Solomon had a four minute, 39 second call.'The report also included phone logs of several calls between Nunes and Parnas on April 12, including one that lasted more than eight minutes. On May 10, Giuliani spoke with former Nunes aide Kash Patel for about 25 minutes, just after Trump's personal attorney spoke to key impeachment player and former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker about Giuliani's upcoming, and ultimately canceled, trip to Ukraine. Patel was on the National Security Council at the time of the May 10 call.A spokesperson for Nunes did not immediately respond to HuffPost's request for comment. As the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Nunes has been one of the White House's most reliable allies in Congress, repeatedly pushing the conspiracy theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election and accusing committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) of knowing and hiding the identity of the intelligence community whistleblower whose bombshell complaint sparked the impeachment investigation.Parnas is an American businessman who was recently indicted on federal campaign finance violations and one of Giuliani's cronies who helped with Trump's dealings in Ukraine. His attorney, Joseph Bondy, said last month that Parnas was prepared to tell Congress that he has information on a 2018 meeting between Nunes and former Ukrainian top prosecutor Victor Shokin, who was ousted for corruption in 2016 before Lutsenko took over. Bondy said that Parnas learned of the meeting directly from Shokin and that the purpose of the meeting was for Nunes to get dirt on Biden.Nunes has dodged questions about whether he actually met with Shokin in Austria to get information on Biden, but'congressional records appeared to corroborate Parnas' claim by showing that Nunes flew to Europe at the same time he's accused of meeting with Shokin. On Tuesday,'Nunes'filed a $435 million defamation lawsuit against CNN'in Virginia federal court based on the network's Nov. 22 story about the Parnas allegations, thereby following through on a threat he made on Fox News last month.Parnas has also alleged that he helped Nunes set up meetings via Skype and over the phone'with two other Ukrainian prosecutors who claimed 'to have evidence that could help [Trump's] reelection campaign.' Nunes was going to speak with the prosecutors in Ukraine, but reportedly canceled the trip after realizing he would have to inform Schiff of his plans, according to Bondy.After being asked about the call logs highlighting Nunes, Schiff stressed to reporters his concern over lawmakers who were potentially involved in the Ukraine case.Schiff calls revelations about Nunes in his committee's report ""deeply concerning"" pic.twitter.com/lHj1M89Ifu'It is, I think, deeply concerning that at a time when the president of the United States was using the power of his office to dig up dirt on a political rival, that there may be evidence that there were members of Congress complicit in that activity,' Schiff said. 'Our focus is on the president's conduct first and foremost. It may be the role of others to evaluate the conduct of members of Congress.'Bondy tweeted after the Intelligence Committee report's release that Nunes 'should have recused' himself 'at the outset of the' committee's impeachment hearings. He also told 'PBS NewsHour' that Nunes 'was definitely part of an attempt to gather information about the Bidens. He was definitely involved in Ukraine. He definitely had involvement in the GOP shadow diplomacy efforts in Ukraine, contrary to his claims.'At a Tuesday press conference held by House Republicans following the report's release, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said that he doesn't 'have a problem with Devin talking to individuals,' and that Nunes 'has a right to talk to anybody.'.@GOPLeader on @RepDevinNunes call records in Impeachment Inquiry Report: ""I don't have a problem with Devin talking to individuals...Devin Nunes has a right to talk to anybody."" pic.twitter.com/rRxN8PL1jiThe story has been updated with details of Nunes' defamation lawsuit against CNN and McCarthy's remarks about Nunes.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"327",1460705314,"The Impeachable Offenses Trump Won’t Be Impeached For","The House Judiciary Committee will begin the process of writing articles of impeachment for President Donald Trump on Wednesday.At a hearing that day, legal scholars will provide the definition of impeachable offenses and explain that impeachable acts need not be written in the criminal code, but are instead 'political offences' against the state. You'll hear that the Constitution's authors described impeachment as necessary to stop a president who would 'betray his trust to foreign powers,' engage in a scheme 'corrupting his electors' or 'pervert his administration into a scheme of peculation or oppression.'These scholars are expected to offer a historical and legal definition of an impeachable act that clearly covers Trump's effort to coerce Ukraine to aid his reelection campaign. But they'll probably also provide ample argument that some of Trump's other, most egregious acts in office could warrant impeachment on their own.Special counsel Robert Mueller detailed multiple acts the president committed to obstruct the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But Mueller claimed that Congress was the only constitutionally legitimate body to judge Trump's acts, as the Department of Justice forbade the criminal prosecution of a sitting president.'The White House has since blocked testimony from former and current officials subpoenaed by Congress to testify about these alleged acts of obstruction of justice. Key among those officials is former White House counsel Don McGahn.McGahn's testimony would be important, as he testified to the special counsel that he refused Trump's order to fire Mueller. Trump then reportedly ordered McGahn to falsify documents so he could claim that he never ordered Mueller's firing after the press reported the incident.One count of impeachment against President Richard Nixon covered his obstruction of justice by 'interfering or endeavoring to interfere with the conduct of investigations by the Department of Justice of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force, and Congressional Committees,' and, 'approving, condoning, acquiescing in, and counselling witnesses with respect to the giving of false or misleading statements.'Congressional efforts to obtain McGahn's testimony are still stuck in the courts. A district court judge ruled against the Trump administration's move to block the testimony in November, but the administration has appealed the ruling.When Trump took office, he became the first president in the modern era to refuse to divest from his business. That meant that he would be able to be paid directly or provided other legal, monetary benefits like copyrights from governments. The Constitution's emoluments clause forbids any federal officeholder from receiving gifts, titles or benefits from governments, foreign and domestic, aside from a salary.Trump's apparent refusal to abide by the emoluments clause since taking office has prompted ongoing lawsuits, House Democrats' passage of legislation to enforce the clause, and limited calls for an article of impeachment to cover Trump's blanket acceptance of benefits and payments from the U.S. and foreign governments.But the act that most clearly looks impeachable among Trump's emoluments violations is his effort to get the federal government to use his struggling Trump National Doral Miami Resort for the upcoming 2020 summit of the Group of Seven nations.Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney announced that the G-7 summit would take place at the president's resort on Oct. 17. He claimed that Trump would not be 'making any money off of this.' But two days later, Trump reversed his decision, blaming the media and Democrats when it was actually an outcry by congressional Republicans that forced the reversal.What would be revealed later was that Doral was never on the original list of sites considered by the Secret Service for the G-7 summit. Instead, it was added very late in the review process on direction from the president, according to a Washington Post report based on Secret Service documents.Based on the known facts, this was apparently an effort by Trump to use his office to pump money into a flagging property he owns. It's not the only example, either. The House Oversight Committee continues to investigate odd Air Force refueling stops in Scotland that led some crew members to stay at Trump's Turnberry Resort.Trump ran for president in 2016 on a platform calling for the United States military to commit more war crimes. He fulfilled his support for war crimes on Nov. 15 when he issued pardons for two Army officers convicted of war crimes and one Navy SEAL standing trial for war crimes.'These pardons have aggravated military leadership for signaling internally and to the world that the highest officer of the U.S. government is cool with war crimes. Numerous veterans have spoken out against Trump's pardons as potentially undermining the mission of U.S. military forces and U.S. national security.It's not just that Trump has endorsed war crimes by way of pardon; he also says the U.S. military is committing them in Syria right now.After initially claiming that U.S. troops would be leaving Syria altogether, Trump later claimed that the military had occupied oil fields for the U.S. to steal. This is a war crime, according to countless international agreements, as'Slate'pointed out'at the time.'We've secured the oil and, therefore, a small number of U.S. troops will remain in the area,' Trump said at a press conference in October after U.S. troops withdrew from the Turkey-Syria border to allow the Turkish military to attack Syrian Kurds. 'Where they have the oil. And we're going to be protecting it, and we'll be deciding what we're going to do with it in the future.'These are just the known deeds Trump has committed that could rise to the level of impeachable offenses, as scholars will argue with regard to his dealings with Ukraine.But for Trump, a fabulist who built his fame and fortune on a series of sometimes-criminal frauds, there is always an array of acts that could be impeachable if investigated further.'Is Trump's policy regarding Turkey solely motivated by his personal financial interests, as former national security adviser John Bolton reportedly suggested? Did Trump interfere in the Pentagon bidding process to prevent Amazon from receiving a massive contract? Did he intervene in the bidding process to help a Republican Party donor win a contract related to the U.S.-Mexico border wall?Perhaps the constitutional scholars could provide some additional insight into what else the president may have done that the Constitution's authors would want no part of.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"328",1460745709,"House Committee Report: Trump Misused Power, Obstructed Congress","WASHINGTON (AP) ' President Donald Trump seriously misused the power of his office for personal political gain by seeking foreign intervention in the American election process and obstructed Congress by stonewalling efforts to investigate, a House report released Tuesday  concluded in findings that form the basis for possible impeachment.The 300-page report from Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee does not render a judgment on whether Trump's actions stemming from a July 25 phone call with Ukraine rise to the level of 'high crimes and misdemeanors' warranting impeachment. That is for Congress to decide. But it details 'significant misconduct' by the president that the House Judiciary Committee will begin to assess Wednesday.'The evidence that we have found is really quite overwhelming that the president used the power of his office to secure political favors and abuse the trust American people put in him and jeopardize our security,' Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told The Associated Press.'It was a difficult decision to go down this road, because it's so consequential for the country,' he said. But 'the president was the author of his own impeachment inquiry by repeatedly seeking foreign help in his election campaigns.'Schiff added: 'Americans need to understand that this president is putting his personal political interests above theirs. And that it's endangering the country.'In a statement, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said, 'Chairman Schiff and the Democrats utterly failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump.' She said the report 'reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger straining to prove something when there is evidence of nothing.'The president, at a NATO meeting in London, called the impeachment effort by rival Democrats 'unpatriotic,' and said he wouldn't be watching Wednesday's hearing.The 'Trump-Ukraine Impeachment Inquiry Report' provides a detailed, stunning, account of a shadow diplomacy run by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, resulting in layers of allegations that can be distilled into specific acts, like bribery or obstruction, and the more amorphous allegation that Trump abused his power by putting his interests above the nation.Based on two months of investigation sparked by a still-anonymous government whistleblower's complaint, the report relies heavily on testimony from current and former U.S. officials who defied White House orders not to appear.The inquiry found that Trump 'solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection,' Schiff wrote in the report's preface. In doing so, the president 'sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security,' the report said. When Congress began investigating, it added, Trump obstructed the investigation like no other president in history.Along with revelations from earlier testimony, the report included previously unreleased cell phone records raising fresh questions about Giuliani's interactions with the top Republican on the intelligence panel, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, and the White House. Nunes declined to comment.The House intelligence panel voted later Tuesday, in a party-line tally, to send the document to the Judiciary Committee.Republicans defended the president in their own 123-page rebuttal claiming Trump never intended to pressure Ukraine when he asked for a 'favor' ' investigations of Democrats and Joe Biden. They say the military aid the White House was withholding was not being used as leverage, as Democrats claim ' and besides, the $400 million was ultimately released, although only after a congressional outcry. Democrats, they argue, just want to undo the 2016 election.For Republicans falling in line behind Trump, the inquiry is simply a 'hoax.' Trump criticized the House for pushing forward with the proceedings while he was overseas, a breach of political decorum that traditionally leaves partisan differences at the water's edge.House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy called on Democrats to end the impeachment 'nightmare.' He said, 'They're concerned if they do not impeach this president they cant beat him in an election.'The report will lay the foundation for the Judiciary Committee to assess potential articles of impeachment, presenting a history-making test of political judgment with a case that is dividing Congress and the country.In prefacing it, Schiff drew deeply from history, citing George Washington, Alexander Hamilton and other Founding Fathers, to explain grounds for impeachment 'as a remedy of last resort.'Democrats once hoped to sway Republicans to consider Trump's removal, but they are now facing a ever-hardening partisan split over the swift-moving proceedings on impeaching the president.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi faces a critical moment of her leadership as she steers the process ahead after initially resisting the impeachment inquiry, warning it was too divisive for the country and required bipartisan support.Possible grounds for impeachment are focused on whether Trump abused his office as he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to open investigations into Trump's political rivals. At the time, Trump was withholding $400 million in military aid, jeopardizing key support as Ukraine faces an aggressive Russia at its border.The report also accuses Trump of becoming the 'first and only<U+2033> president in U.S. history to 'openly and indiscriminately' defy House's constitutional authority to conduct the impeachment proceedings by instructing officials not to comply with subpoenas for documents and testimony.For Democrats marching into what is now a largely partisan process, the political challenge if they proceed is to craft the impeachment articles in a way that will draw the most support from their ranks and not expose Pelosi's majority to messy divisions, especially as Republicans stand lockstep with the president.While liberal Democrats are pushing the party to go further and incorporate the findings from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and other actions by Trump, more centrist and moderate Democrats prefer to stick with the Ukraine matter as a simpler narrative that Americans understand.Trump's campaign is spending robustly to run ads against front-line freshmen lawmakers, many from districts Trump won in 2016 but that flipped in 2018 to give Democrats the House majority. Pelosi will be protective of these lawmakers as the proceedings unfold.Hearing from legal experts at Wednesday's session, Democrats could begin drafting articles of impeachment against the president in a matter of days. The Judiciary Committee could vote next week and the full House Could vote by Christmas. Then it moves to the Senate for a trial in 2020.The White House declined an invitation to participate Wednesday, with counsel Pat Cipollone denouncing the proceedings as a 'baseless and highly partisan inquiry.'Trump had previously suggested he might be willing to offer written testimony under certain conditions, though aides suggested they did not anticipate Democrats would ever agree to them.Cipollone, who will brief Senate Republicans on Wednesday, left open the question of whether White House officials would participate in additional House hearings.Republicans on the committee, led by Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, plan to use procedural moves to stall the process and portray the inquiry as unfair to the president.House rules provide the president and his attorneys the right to cross-examine witnesses and review evidence before the committee, but little ability to bring forward witnesses of their own.___Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Colleen Long, Eric Tucker and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"329",1460775399,"Lindsey Graham Breaks Ranks With Trump, Declares Ukraine Conspiracy Theory False","Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has broken ranks with President Donald Trump and many of his GOP allies, declaring Tuesday that he is '1,000% confident' that Russia, not Ukraine, interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.His view contradicts a conspiracy theory backed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and peddled by Trump and others in his party that Ukraine meddled in the presidential election and framed the Russians.'It was the Russians. I'm 1,000% confident that the hack of the [Democratic National Committee] was by Russian operatives, no one else,' Graham told reporters on Capitol Hill.'In a subsequent interview with CNN, Graham said he had 'no doubt' that it was the Russians who hacked the emails of the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta.'It wasn't Ukraine. Russia was behind the stolen DNC emails and Podesta and all that good stuff,' the senator said.'So as to the Ukraine, they had zero to do with the hacking of the DNC and the stealing of the emails. Whether or not people from the Ukraine met with DNC operatives, I don't know. All I've seen is press reports that no one has validated.'The senator joins Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who also told reporters on Tuesday that he'd seen no evidence of Ukrainian meddling, in distancing himself from the theory floated by some of their Republican colleagues.The break comes amid the House impeachment inquiry, which was triggered by the president's dealings with Ukraine. At the center of the probe is a July 25 phone call to Ukraine in which Trump referenced the hacking theory to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, urging him to look into CrowdStrike, a California-based cybersecurity firm that had investigated the breach of the DNC email system.'The president called into 'Fox & Friends' recently to again push the theory, claiming that CrowdStrike is owned by a 'wealthy Ukrainian.' The company is U.S.-owned.Politico and CNN reported Monday that a GOP-led Senate Intelligence Committee found no evidence when investigating allegations of interference by Ukraine, according to sources with direct knowledge of the inquiry.'Graham's comments contrast with those of Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who declined to directly refute the theory and refused to say whether he saw evidence that Ukraine interfered, despite his own committee's conclusion that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election and was 'overtly and almost invariably supportive of then-candidate Trump.'Graham is usually a devoted Trump defender. He has'blocked a Senate resolution'to formally recognize the Armenian genocide at the behest of the White House,'opened a formal investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden's work in Ukraine despite the claims of corruption being widely discredited and unsubstantiated, and repeatedly denied unfavorable but damning testimony against Trump during the impeachment inquiry.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Cooper asked.'Yes, they did, and that's noted in the report,' Dean responded.CNN's chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Dean had made 'a really important point' because both Nixon and President Bill Clinton had been 'much more forthcoming' in cooperating with the impeachment investigations against them than Trump.'It would be very surprising to me in light of all this that obstruction of Congress isn't a separate article of impeachment in addition to the abuse of power on the whole Ukraine relationship,' Toobin added.Replied Dean: 'And much more difficult for the Senate to vote against.'Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

'Like a good lawyer, I am gathering evidence to defend my client against the false charges being leveled against him.'Federal prosecutors are investigating Giuliani in connection with two of his now-indicted business associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, regarding their activities in Ukraine. Subpoenas issued to those connected to the three indicate a widespread investigation into Giuliani's consulting work.Multiple witnesses in the House's inquiry have also testified that Giuliani directed a shadow U.S. diplomacy in Ukraine in an effort to pressure the country to publicly announce investigations desired by Trump. Gordon Sondland, a Republican donor whom Trump appointed U.S. ambassador to the European Union, testified to House investigators that the president gave him 'express direction' to work with Giuliani on pressuring Ukraine to conduct investigations.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"339",1461696336,"Democrats Hint They're Mulling Impeaching Trump For More Than Just Ukraine","As the House Judiciary Committee began hearings to craft articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) suggested the charges may not be limited to the president's Ukraine-related acts by raising Trump's alleged obstruction of the earlier investigation into his 2016 campaign.Nadler outlined how Trump first sought to coerce Ukraine into helping his 2020 reelection campaign and then obstructed the ensuing investigation. Then the chairman noted this followed a 'pattern of conduct.''President Trump welcomed foreign interference in the 2016 election,' Nadler said. 'He demanded it for the 2020 election. In both cases, he got caught. And in both cases, he did everything in his power to prevent the American people from learning the truth about his conduct.'Nadler's decision to make that link appears to indicate that Democrats are also considering Trump's obstruction of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and of Congress' efforts to follow up on it as the basis for a potential article of impeachment.Nadler's statement came during a hearing featuring four constitutional law experts discussing whether Trump's acts related to Ukraine reached the legal and historical definition of an impeachable offense. During the hearing, Democratic committee counsel Norm Eisen also pressed witnesses as to whether the acts of obstruction alleged by Mueller constituted obstruction of justice.Three of the four experts argued that the impeachment clause was added to the Constitution to cover abuses of power like Trump's actions.'This is precisely the misconduct the framers created the Constitution, including impeachment, in order to protect against,' said Michael Gerhardt, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law.George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley, the witness called by the Republican minority, was the lone expert to say that Congress had not yet proven that Trump had committed an impeachable offense.'A majority of the expert witnesses looked at the facts and saw impeachable conduct.'The evidence reveals a president who used the powers of his office to demand that a foreign government participate in undermining a competing candidate for the presidency,' said Pamela Karlan, a Stanford Law School professor.Trump abused 'the power of his office that no one else could possibly have used in order to gain an advantage for himself,' said Noah Feldman, a Harvard Law School professor.The plot to coerce Ukraine into tarring a potential political opponent as corrupt by withholding military aid and a White House meeting met the standard for impeachable offenses as defined at the time the Constitution was written, according to Gerhardt, Karlan and Feldman.'We know that [the impeachment clause] was designed to reach a president who acts to subvert an election ' whether it is the election that brought him into office or an upcoming election where he seeks a second term,' Karlan said.Turley, the lone dissenter among the legal experts, argued that Trump's actions were wrong, but that Congress had not heard from enough 'fact witnesses' to prove that he committed an impeachable act. He also argued there is not enough evidence to label Trump's actions toward Ukraine as 'bribery.' And he criticized Congress for moving too quickly toward impeachment.The constitutional scholars were also asked whether it mattered that the president ultimately released the military aid he withheld from Ukraine.'The fact that [President Richard] Nixon was not ultimately successful in covering up the Watergate break-in was not grounds for not impeaching him,' Feldman said. 'The attempt itself was the impeachable act.'They also agreed that Trump's refusal to obey subpoenas for documents and witness testimony is unprecedented, constitutes obstruction of justice, and is impeachable in and of itself.'A president who will not cooperate in impeachment is putting himself above the law,' Feldman said.The alleged obstruction of the Mueller investigation also met the standard of an impeachable offense, they argued.'This evidence that's been put forward by Mr. Mueller and is in the public record is very strong evidence of obstruction of justice,' Gerhardt said.As the House Intelligence Committee's GOP members had earlier done, the Judiciary Committee's Republicans defended the president's actions and sought to cast the hearing as a pointless show for TV and the impeachment investigation as an empty political vendetta against the president.'You just don't like the guy,' said Rep. Doug Collins (Ga.), the committee's ranking Republican.Democrats have wanted to impeach Trump ever since he took office, Collins claimed. (In fact, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) resisted calls for impeachment from her caucus until the intelligence community whistleblower's complaint came to light.)Collins derided the witnesses by suggesting their testimony would show why few Americans want to go to law school. (Collins is a graduate of Atlanta's John Marshall Law School.) He also suggested the professors could not have read the testimony and reports from the House Intelligence Committee and, therefore, their opinions were worthless.This was met by an angry rebuke from Karlan in an off-the-cuff remark during her opening statement.'I would like to say to you, sir, I read transcripts of every witness who appeared in live hearings. I would not speak about these things without reviewing the facts. I am insulted by the suggestion as a law professor that I don't care about those facts,' Karlan said.Republicans also attempted to muck up the hearings with repeated parliamentary inquiries seeking to subpoena both the whistleblower and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and to delay the hearing. They were all defeated on party-line votes.Before the hearing, House Democrats held a caucus meeting where Schiff presented the findings of the Intelligence Committee's impeachment report, which was greeted with an ovation.'This is a solemn thing. It wasn't a lot of rah-rah cheers,' Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) said.Pelosi 'spoke about the gravity and somber nature of this moment,' according to a senior Democratic aide. The speaker then asked the lawmakers to discuss what they were hearing from their constituents at home. Caucus members affirmed their support for continuing the impeachment proceedings.No member of the caucus challenged the investigation or suggested that 'this is the wrong thing, we can't go forward,' Takano added.'It seems like there's a lot of unity among the caucus on this point,' Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said.Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here's how.",2019-12-04 17:02:15
"340",1461696335,"Democrats Know They’re Going To Impeach Trump — Now It’s Just A Matter Of When","WASHINGTON <U+2015> Democrats ended their first day of impeachment hearings in the Judiciary Committee Wednesday by stressing that they haven't made up their minds on the matter.'We haven't even decided whether to impeach or not,' committee member Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) told HuffPost, despite repeatedly arguing for impeachment over the last year.'Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) also said this week he hadn't decided on impeachment, as did fellow California Democrat Eric Swalwell.Democrats are trying mightily to avoid the perception that they're simply playing out the string on impeachment and that the current proceedings before the Judiciary Committee are just a show before they inevitably vote.'During a closed-door meeting Wednesday morning <U+2015> one in which staff was barred from entering and members couldn't bring in their phones <U+2015> Democrats gave Schiff a standing ovation after he presented his committee's report on the president's efforts to pervert U.S. foreign policy for his own personal benefit. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) then spoke about the seriousness of the moment, and she asked members a question: 'Are you ready?'The answer from Democrats seems to be a resounding yes, but they carried forth the message to reporters that this was a 'somber' process.'The majority wants to be as comprehensive and as careful as possible in this process, where we have a pretty solemn sense about what we're doing right now,' Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said.'As solemn as Democrats want the process to be, their minds are, largely <U+2015> understandably <U+2015> made up. President Donald Trump acted improperly in withholding security aid to Ukraine in order to compel a political investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden.The real question in the House Democratic Caucus is whether impeachment advocates would be better served by slowing down the process, perhaps punting an impeachment vote into the new year, and trying to build greater support for their position with even more hearings and maybe even more articles of impeachment.Polling on impeachment hasn't really moved since Democrats began the process in October, and there doesn't appear to be a single House Republican who's been convinced to impeach the president.Even the once-impeachment-curious Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) told HuffPost Wednesday that it would take a lot more than the current facts for him to vote with Democrats <U+2015> like White House officials (who have so far refused to testify) admitting firsthand knowledge of a quid pro quo.That sort of testimony would take months to compel, and there's no guarantee it would ever happen or provide a critical smoking gun to a case that already has, in the minds of many Democrats, multiple smoking guns.The current thinking among Democrats seems to be that they should just vote before they leave for Christmas, avoiding the GOP talking point that they impeached the president in an election year.'We made the factual case,' Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) told HuffPost, mentioning the Intelligence Committee hearings and the 300-page report on the Ukraine scandal. 'Now we should accept those facts and vote, and not allow for the Republicans to engage in antics or distracted tactics, and for the committee hearings to turn into a partisan circus.'Khanna said the White House just wanted to 'run out the clock' on impeachment. 'One day, history will record that the actions and abuse was even much worse than what the Schiff report uncovered,' Khanna said. 'But the Schiff report has more than cleared that hurdle for impeachment.'Democrats believe they risk giving the impression that the case for impeachment is not overwhelming, that not acting swiftly and decisively invites the sense that this was a close call.Democratic Chief Deputy Whip Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said Wednesday that an impeachment vote before the end of the year was 'within the realm of possibility,' and that it would be a 'mistake' to wait for courts to rule on their outstanding subpoenas. And while Democratic leadership has been careful to not provide a firm timeline, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Wednesday there was still time before the end of the year to vote on impeachment.Yet Democrats are trying to balance the impression that they've pre-judged the case before it is even made in the Judiciary Committee. That's why members are now insisting that their minds aren't made up <U+2015> even when they are.One aspect that's not decided is how many impeachment articles Democrats should draft. In addition to Ukraine, many Democrats have talked about including the president's obstruction of justice during special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into his 2016 campaign.'Democrats seem less enthused about including an article detailing the president's violation of the Constitution's 'emoluments clause,' which prohibits officers of the U.S. government from accepting gifts from foreign governments. Since Trump refused to divest from his business when he became president, foreign dignitaries can line his pockets by staying at the Trump Hotel when they visit Washington.'We're just not there yet to discuss all of those things,' Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said Wednesday.' 'But obviously, we're focusing on the evidence that's in front of us, and so far that has been around the Mueller report and and mostly around Ukraine.''Some Democrats have asked leadership to make the articles more comprehensive so that more vulnerable members could performatively vote against certain articles, like an 'emoluments clause' violation and obstruction of justice while advancing the Ukraine issues to the Senate.But Democrats are also wary of 'clearing' Trump on any grounds, or in splitting their caucus on impeachment.Republicans are almost certain to vote unanimously against impeachment, passing the case off to the Republican-held Senate where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) can tightly control the process.McConnell hasn't said definitively how he'll handle impeachment, but he's suggested he could drag on a trial for months, pushing the case as close to Election Day as possible in a gambit to pressure moderate Democratic senators to vote no.Either way, there doesn't appear to be any fact Democrats could uncover that would move Republicans to support impeachment.'When HuffPost asked former Republican Justin Amash, who is now an Independent and supports impeachment, the Michigan congressman said his former GOP colleagues had made up their minds.Democrats, Amash said, were in a 'no-win situation,' because the longer they wait, the closer they get to the election.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

"341",1461696334,"Law Professor Apologizes To Barron Trump And Burns President At Same Time","A legal expert at Wednesday's impeachment hearing has apologized for using the president's son in an analogy <U+2015> and, in the process, burned Donald Trump even harder.During an explanation on the limits of presidential power, Stanford Law professor Pamela S. Karlan explained that, although 'the president can name his son Barron, he cannot make him a baron.'Trump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany immediately accused Karlan of dragging 'a 13-year-old child into the impeachment nonsense,' according to the New York Post. 'Pamela Karlan thought she was being clever and going for laughs, but she instead reinforced for all Americans that Democrats have no boundaries when it comes to their hatred of everything related to President Trump.'Melania Trump also tried to rally supporters by accusing Karlan of using a child to engage in 'very angry and obviously biased public pandering.'A minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics. Pamela Karlan, you should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering, and using a child to do it.The Trump team managed to raise enough of a snit that Karlan apologized a few hours later for mentioning Barron during her testimony.However, her apology also contained a pointed criticism of what many believe is the president's worst personality quality: an unwillingness to take responsibility or admit he was wrong about anything.Karlan apologizes for her quip about Trump's son, Baron. 'I wish the president would apologize for the things that he's done,' she added. But she added again she apologizesMany Twitter users felt that Karlan wasn't the only one who owed someone an apology.I wish Trump would apologize to Greta Thurnberg and the kids he locked in cages.Will Melania apologize for her husband putting kids and babies in cages?What if she'd used a different example ? A president may name his son Duke or Earl but not dub him a duke or earl. That was her only point but Rethugs will twist the hell out of this.Republicans don't understand a simple pun. Instead they get their jockey shorts in a knot and start yelling.Going after Baron was not right, but Trump should be held to the same standard, if not higher, and apologize for all the ""nicknames"" he's given out over the years as well.

"342",1461781486,"Impeachment Takeaways: History Lessons, Partisan Feuds","WASHINGTON (AP) ' The next phase of the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump moved to the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday with public hearings featuring professors of law who discussed the constitutional origins of Congress' impeachment power.Three of the lawyers were chosen by Democrats, one by Republicans, and the experts split much like the committee, along partisan lines, over whether Trump committed an impeachable offense when he asked the president of Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden.The lofty arguments about the Constitution were frequently interrupted by partisan sniping among committee members.Here are some takeaways from the hearing:REPUBLICAN DISRUPTIONRepublicans allied with the president used the hearing to force procedural votes and delay the proceedings, adding to an unruly atmosphere even with the professors' academic recounting of constitutional principles.GOP members interrupted House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler and the expert witnesses, calling for more Republican witnesses, for a postponement of the hearing and for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff to be called to testify. Schiff led the investigation into Trump's dealings with Ukraine.The top Republican on the Judiciary panel, Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, said the impeachment process is a 'sham.' And he said the committee had been sidelined as other panels led the impeachment investigation.'What a disgrace to this committee, to have the committee of impeachment simply take from other committees and rubber stamp,' Collins said.Collins also criticized the quick pace of the impeachment probe. Democrats hope to hold a final vote by Christmas.'If you want to know what's really driving this, there are two things ' a clock and a calendar,' Collins said.___HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORSThe four law professors who testified brought history lessons to the hearing, with talk of American Founding Fathers and British monarchs, of the 18th-century Constitutional Convention and the 20th-century impeachment proceedings of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.Their testimony had a contemporary purpose, too, as Democrats look to bolster the argument for impeachment by having outside constitutional experts make the case that Trump committed an impeachable offense.Three of the witnesses made clear they thought Trump's conduct met the definition of an abuse of power that the constitutional framers had in mind for removal of a commander in chief. They said the president's interaction with Ukraine amounted to high crimes and misdemeanors, the impeachment standard set out in the Constitution.'If what we are talking about is not impeachable,' said Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor, 'then nothing is impeachable.'Pamela Karlan, a Stanford Law School professor, said the Founding Fathers were particularly concerned about foreign interference in American politics.'The very idea that a president might seek the aid of a foreign government in his reelection campaign would have horrified them,' Karlan said. 'But based on the evidentiary record, that is what President Trump has done.'The lone dissenter was Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University professor, who said that although he is not a supporter of the president, he found the case against Trump legally weak and warned that it would 'collapse' amid an absence of criminal intent.___BRIBERY IN THE CONSTITUTIONThe three Democratic witnesses agreed that Trump could be impeached for bribery as it is defined in the Constitution. Democrats have hinted that bribery could be one of the articles of impeachment.Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School said the 'clear sense' of the framers on bribery was 'when the president corruptly asked for or received something of value to him from someone who could be affected by his official office.''So if the House of Representatives and the members of this committee were to determine that getting the investigations either announced or undertaken was a thing of value to President Trump, that was what he sought, then this committee and this House could safely conclude that the president had committed bribery under the Constitution,' Feldman said.Karlan said that if Congress concludes that Trump asked for the investigations of Biden and his son to aid his reelection, 'then yes, you have bribery here.'Turley disagreed, warning against using a 'boundless interpretation' of bribery.'The statement has been made, not just by these witnesses but Chairman Schiff and others, that this is a clear case of bribery. It's not,' Turley said.___ANY QUESTIONS?There may have been four law professors at the hearing, but many of the lawmakers limited their questions to witnesses summoned by their own party ' and some asked none at all.Several GOP lawmakers, bypassing the chance to pose questions to witnesses, used their five-minute allotments with speeches that defended the president and attacked the impeachment proceedings as partisan and rushed.Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio praised the testimony of Turley, the GOP-selected witness, but didn't actually direct any questions to him.Republican Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas asked a series of questions of Turley but also chose to ignore the three witnesses Democrats relied on to make their impeachment case.Democrats mostly did the same, focusing their queries to witnesses brought in by their party. Rep. Cedric Richmond, of Louisiana, brought up Turley several times but asked other witnesses ' not him ' about his testimony.Still, there were some notable exceptions, such as when Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida challenged the witnesses on what he said were Democratic biases and anti-Trump leanings. H e asked Gerhardt and Karlan about contributions they'd made to Democrats including President Barack Obama.He also asked all the witnesses to raise their hands if they had personal knowledge of the events at hand; none did.'And let the record reflect no personal knowledge of a single fact,' Gaetz said.When it was his turn, Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, confronted Turley directly on his past statements ' and even legal involvement ' in prior impeachment proceedings.___MUELLER IN THE MIXDemocrats have been debating whether to include an article on obstruction of justice as laid out in the report by special counsel Robert Mueller.That report, released in April, laid out potential acts of obstruction but declined to make a determination one way or the other about whether the president had illegally subverted the Russia investigation, with Mueller citing Justice Department guidelines that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime. He essentially left it up to Congress to decide.On Wednesday, Nadler signaled that he believes Mueller's findings should be included, saying in his opening statement that Trump took 'extraordinary and unprecedented steps' to obstruct the special counsel's investigation.He said that Trump not only 'welcomed foreign interference in the 2016 election' ' the focus of Mueller's investigation ' but also 'demanded it for the 2020 election.'Democrats haven't yet decided whether to include Mueller's investigation in any articles of impeachment. But many members have argued that it should be included.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here's how.",2019-12-04 21:14:26
"343",1461813420,"The Latest Biden Campaign Ad Is A Supercut Of World Leaders Laughing At Trump","Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign pounced Wednesday evening after a viral video featuring frustrated world leaders mocking President Donald Trump circulated online. The Democratic candidate released a new attack ad saying the country needed a leader the 'world respects.'The minute-long clip begins with a supercut of diplomats and world leaders laughing at Trump, including footage from a speech at the United Nations in 2018 and this week's video from the NATO conference in London.'The world sees Trump for what he is: insincere, ill-informed, corrupt,' Biden says in a voiceover in the ad. 'Dangerously incompetent and incapable, in my view, of world leadership.'The world is laughing at President Trump. They see him for what he really is: dangerously incompetent and incapable of world leadership.We cannot give him four more years as commander in chief. pic.twitter.com/IR8K2k54YQThe ad comes less than a day after several world leaders ' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Britain's Princess Anne ' were shown on video at the NATO summit in London gathered around as'Trump was mocked'over his behavior at the meeting.'You just watch his team's jaws drop to the floor,' Trudeau says in the clip. He later confirmed he had been discussing Trump (others in the group moved to distance themselves from the ridicule, including Johnson), although Trudeau said he still had a 'very good relationship' with his U.S. counterpart.The footage capped off a difficult visit for a president who had largely hoped to tout his negotiating skills and pressure his peers to pay more for the partnership's funding.Trump abruptly left the NATO meeting earlier than expected on Wednesday, canceling a news conference and heading home as the impeachment inquiry into his behavior moved into a new phase. He appeared to have heard about the video, telling reporters before his departure that Trudeau was 'two-faced' and suggesting the Canadian leader was simply disappointed in his request that the country contribute more money to NATO.Biden has remained deeply critical of the Trump presidency throughout his 2020 primary campaign, repeatedly casting the upcoming election as a reckoning for American values. Both the former vice president and his son Hunter have been mentioned frequently in the impeachment inquiry since Trump repeatedly pressured the leader of Ukraine to investigate them. Neither Biden nor his son has been accused of wrongdoing.'We can overcome four years of Donald Trump, but eight years will literally, literally begin to change the character of this nation, and we cannot let that happen,' Biden said last weekend as he kicked off his 'No Malarkey' bus tour.
